Uh, I got some incredibly cool stuff. I got some incredibly bad stuff. Um, but clearly I hit something that stirred up emotions and made people interested and inspired people and it's really cool.**

这段时间简直太疯狂了。我不知道一个人怎么消化得了这一切。我大概还需要再一个星期光是回邮件。我收到了一些超酷的东西，也收到了一些超糟糕的东西。但很明显，我触动了某种东西——激发了人们的情绪，让人们产生了兴趣和灵感，这真的很酷。

(5) [1:28-1:52] **And a lot of people have been working on, you know, AI and even personal assistance. Like what is it that made OpenClaw take off? I think my big difference is that it actually runs on your computer. Like everything I saw so far runs in the cloud. It's like it can do a few things if you run on your computer. It can do every effing thing, right? So that's way more powerful.**

"很多人一直在做 AI 甚至个人助手这类东西。是什么让 **OpenClaw** 火起来的？" "我觉得最大的区别在于它实际上运行在你的电脑上。我之前看到的所有东西都跑在云端。如果运行在你的电脑上，它能做所有该死的事情，对吧？所以这要强大得多。"

(10) [3:12-3:38] **I think that's a natural next step. Like okay I want to book a restaurant, my bot will reach out to the restaurant bot and do the negotiation, like because it's more efficient. Or maybe it's like an old restaurant. So my bot needs to actually get some human work done so that the human then calls the restaurant because they don't like bots. Or walks there to stand in line if he doesn't get a robot for — or the owner of the bot.**

"我觉得这是自然的下一步。比如我想订一家餐厅，我的机器人会联系餐厅的机器人来协商，因为这样更高效。或者也许那是家老派餐厅，我的机器人就得找个人类帮忙——让人去打电话订位，因为他们不喜欢机器人。或者直接走过去排队——如果搞不到机器人帮忙的话（笑）。"

Maybe one is our relationship bot that gets like everything in between. Uh I don't know. We're so early. There's still so many things that we haven't really figured out if it actually works. But I feel we are on the timeline now.**

"我设想也许我可以有多个机器人——比如一个专精私人生活，一个管工作事务。也许还有一个'关系机器人'处理两者之间的一切。我也不确定。我们还处于非常早期的阶段，还有太多事情没弄清楚到底行不行。但我觉得我们已经踏上了那条时间线。"

(12) [4:07-4:31] **It seems like everyone was chasing sort of like the centralized god intelligence and what has sort of emerged over the past 10 days or so is sort of like the swarm intelligence and the community intelligence. I think that if you look at one human being, what can one human being actually achieve? Do you think one human being could make an iPhone or one human being could go to space?**

Even though it's generalized intelligence, what if it actually is also specialized intelligence? So, it's going to be very exciting, cool.**

"一个人大概连食物都找不到。但作为一个群体我们会分工专精；作为更大的社会，分工更加精细。那我们能从中学到什么应用到 AI 上呢？我们已经有了在特定领域专精的 AI。虽然它是通用智能，但如果它同时也是专业智能呢？这将会非常令人兴奋。"

(14) [5:03-5:37] **Yeah. You kind of like opened a window into the future and now a ton of people are building on it and have sort of like their aha moment. Can you walk me back to when you had your aha moment and recount that very moment? I wanted something to just type stuff so my computer would do stuff, very simple. And then I built a version of that in May, June that was cool but wasn't really it. And then I built a whole bunch of other stuff and kind of like build up my army.**

"你打开了一扇通往未来的窗户，现在很多人在此基础上构建，也有了他们自己的顿悟时刻。你能带我回到你的顿悟时刻吗？重新讲述那个瞬间？" "我就是想要一个简单的东西——我打字，然后电脑就执行。五六月份我做了一个版本，挺酷的但还不太对。之后我又做了一大堆其他东西，算是在积蓄力量。"

And doing stuff was coding. You were coding stuff. Yeah, of course. Were you coding something else or were you coding the thing itself? No, no, that was just like the need was again there and I'm like...**

"然后到了十一月，有一天我又想要这个了。我走到厨房，只想看看电脑是不是还在干活还是干完了——当时在做的就是写代码。" "你在写代码？" "是啊当然。" "你是在写别的东西还是在写这个项目本身？" "不不，就是那个需求又回来了……"

Yeah. You can just do things.**

"你当时在写什么？在做什么项目？" "天呐，你看我 **GitHub** 上大概有 40 个项目，我都记不清了。应该是 **Summarize**——一个小 **CLI** 应用，你可以给它任何东西比如播客或者像这样的访谈，它会帮你做摘要，还能在终端里展示幻灯片——现在终端能做到这些了。" "是啊，现在什么都能做。"

I mean the last project I worked two months on Wipe Tunnel to the point where it got so good that I was catching myself always like coding next to my — when I was at my friends' and I'm like I need to stop this, this is like too addictive.**

"出于对电脑的热爱，你就开始捣鼓各种东西。你实际上是从退休状态回来的，对吧？回来玩 AI，然后越来越上瘾，想要随时随地都能做，甚至在手机上。" "上一个项目 **Wipe Tunnel** 我做了两个月，做到太好了以至于我发现自己在朋友家都忍不住在旁边写代码。我觉得我得停下来，这太上瘾了。"

You don't think about compaction, new sessions, which folder I'm in, which model I'm in. I mean you can, I want to leave it open for power users.**

"然后到了十一月，我的需求又回来了，开始做 **CloudBot**——现在叫 **OpenClaw**。最开始我想'又重建了一遍，但这次做得更好了。'这次你不是在终端里打字，而是像跟朋友聊天。你不用操心什么压缩、新会话、在哪个文件夹、用什么模型——当然这些功能我也保留给高级用户。"

(19) [7:20-7:47] **But usually you just talk to a friend and the friend is like this ghost or entity or whatever you want to call it that can control your mouse and your keyboard and can just do stuff. Yeah. And when did you have that aha moment when you were like "wow this is doing way more things than I actually thought it could"? Literally it took me one hour for the very shitty initial prototype.**

"但通常你就是在跟一个朋友聊天，而这个朋友就像一个幽灵或实体——随便你怎么叫它——它能控制你的鼠标和键盘，直接帮你做事。" "那你是什么时候有那个顿悟时刻的？就是'哇，这东西做到的远超我预期'？" "说真的，那个非常粗糙的初始原型我只花了一小时。"

(20) [7:47-8:17] **It was just a little bit of glue between a dependency that connects WhatsApp and Claude Code, and then I would call out to Claude Code and get the string out of Claude Code. It would be slow but it worked. But I wanted images, cuz you know you want pictures. I want the model to send some selfies or whatever and I want the model to create images and send me back. So that took me another few hours and then I went to Marrakesh for a birthday party and the internet wasn't that good, you know.**

"它就是在连接 **WhatsApp** 和 **Claude Code** 的依赖库之间做了一层胶水代码。我会调用 **Claude Code** 然后拿到返回的字符串。很慢，但能用。不过我还想要图片——你懂的，谁不想看图呢。我想让模型发自拍或者生成图片发给我。这又多花了几个小时。然后我去了马拉喀什参加一个生日派对，那边网络不太好——"

(21) [8:17-8:42] **WhatsApp works everywhere because I don't know, it's just like text. So I used it a lot — restaurant, "what does this mean", you make a picture and "translate this for me" — and it was just so useful. And it was also really nice about it because it spoke my language, it was a little sassy, it was funny, it was really pleasant to use. And then I was walking and just sending it a voice message and I'm like, "Oh, wait. This can't work. I didn't build that."**

"但 **WhatsApp** 到处都能用——基本上就是文字嘛。所以我用得很频繁——'这家餐厅怎么样'、'这什么意思'、拍张照片'帮我翻译一下'——真的超好用。而且它很对味，有点小俏皮、小幽默，用起来很舒服。然后我走在路上给它发了条语音消息，心想——'等等，这不可能好使啊。我没做这个功能。'"

(22) [8:42-9:15] **Right. And you saw like the type indicator. It's like blinking, blinking, blinking. 10 seconds later, it just replied to me. I'm like, "How in the f did you do that?" And it replied, "Yeah, the model did the following. You sent me a text message." And there was no file ending. So I looked at the header. I found it's opus. So I used ffmpeg to convert it to wave. And then I wanted to transcribe it, but didn't have Whisper installed. But then I looked around and I found this OpenAI key and I just use curl to send it to OpenAI. Got the text back and here I am. And that all in like what, 9 seconds.**

"然后我看到输入指示器在闪……闪……闪。十秒后它就回复了。我说'你到底怎么做到的？'它回复说：'我是这样做的：你发给我一条消息，没有文件后缀名。所以我查看了文件头信息，发现是 **opus** 格式。我用 **ffmpeg** 把它转成了 **wav**。然后我想转录它但没装 **Whisper**，不过我翻了翻发现了一个 **OpenAI** 的密钥，就用 **curl** 发给了 **OpenAI**，拿到了文字——就是这样。'所有这些——大概只花了9秒。"

(23) [9:18-9:50] **And you didn't build or anticipate any of those specific things. No, it turns out because coding models got so good. Coding is really like creative problem solving that maps very well back into the real world. I think there's a huge correlation. They need to be really good at creative problem solving and that's a skill — that's an abstract skill you can apply to code but like to any real world task. So the model had a "oh surprise, there's a magical file. I don't know what it is. I need to solve this" — and it did its best and solved that.**

"你并没有构建或者预想过这些具体功能？" "没有。事实证明是因为编程模型变得太强了。编程本质上就是创造性地解决问题，而这跟现实世界的映射非常好。它们需要非常擅长创造性问题解决——这是一种抽象技能，你可以把它用在代码上，也可以用在任何现实任务上。所以模型遇到的情况是：'哦，有个神秘文件，我不知道是什么，我需要解决这个问题'——然后它尽了全力解决了。"

解析：
* **anticipate** /ænˈtɪsɪpeɪt/ 🔥：动词，预料、预想
* **it turns out** 🔥：短语，事实证明、结果是（口语中非常常用的转折表达）

(24) [9:50-10:17] **And it was even that clever that it chose not to install the local Whisper because it knows that that would require downloading a model which would take probably a few minutes and I'm like impatient, you know. So it really took the most intelligent approach and that was kind of like the moment where I'm like, "Holy fuck." Yeah. That was where I got hooked.**

"而且它甚至聪明到选择不安装本地 **Whisper**，因为它知道那需要下载一个模型，大概要好几分钟——而我是个没耐心的人。所以它真的选择了最聪明的方案。那一刻我就想——'我的天。'就是在那个瞬间，我彻底入坑了。"

解析：
* **clever** /ˈklevər/：形容词，聪明的、机智的
