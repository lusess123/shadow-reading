(1) [19:50-20:01] **So that's the feeling I get when I'm using it. It's like I can do five people's worth of work in like a single day. It's like rocket boosters. It's unbelievable.**

这就是我使用它时的感受。就像一天之内能干五个人的活。就像装了火箭推进器一样，简直难以置信。

解析：
* **five people's worth of work**：五个人份量的工作，🔥 "X's worth of" 是表达"价值/份量"的实用结构
* **rocket boosters** /ˈrɒkɪt ˈbuːstəz/：名词，火箭推进器，这里做比喻
* **unbelievable** /ˌʌnbɪˈliːvəbl/：形容词，难以置信的

---

(2) [20:01-20:19] **Yeah. I think it's going to be really interesting to see how this plays out across large and small companies. I think everyone who's experimenting with this stuff on like a hobbyist level or at like a very small startup, they're just pushing the coding agents as far as they can go because it's like you don't really have time to figure out anything else.**

是啊。看这件事在大公司和小公司之间如何发展会非常有意思。那些在业余爱好者层面、或者在小创业公司里尝试这些工具的人，都在把编程代理推到极限，因为你真的没时间去研究别的东西了。

解析：
* **plays out** 🔥：短语动词，发展、演变（事情如何展开）
* **hobbyist** /ˈhɒbiɪst/：名词，业余爱好者
* **push... as far as they can go**：把……推到极限

---

(3) [20:13-20:35] **Like as a startup, you have limited runway. You're just going to like orient around speed. I think at a bigger company you have a lot more to lose and you have all these other internal processes around code. And you probably already hired like a big engineering team and I think it's going to be very strange as like these individual teams of like one person are like hey that team over there isn't doing the right thing let me just build a prototype that like works better.**

作为创业公司，你的资金跑道有限，你只会围绕速度来做事。而大公司有更多东西可能会失去，还有各种内部流程。你可能已经雇了一个大工程团队，然后会出现一种很奇怪的现象——一个人的小团队会说"那边那个团队做得不对，让我直接做个更好用的原型出来"。

解析：
* **runway** 🔥：名词，跑道，创业圈指"资金能维持的时间"
* **orient around**：围绕……来定方向
* **prototype** /ˈprəʊtətaɪp/：名词，原型

---

(4) [20:35-20:54] **I think at some point it's going to start working better and I think that landscape shift is going to be a very interesting strange thing. My 10-year-old is uh you know he has writing assignments every day and then yesterday was the first day where he used AI.**

我觉得到了某个节点它就会开始变得更好用，而那个格局转变会是一件非常有趣又奇怪的事情。我 10 岁的儿子每天都有写作作业，昨天是他第一次用 AI。

解析：
* **landscape shift**：名词短语，格局转变、态势变化
* **writing assignments**：写作作业

---

(5) [20:54-21:07] **And then I was like this is not a turn of a phrase that a 10-year-old is capable of doing. And then I think about that in this context because we you know are working with a lot of 18 to 22 year olds who you know they've done internships but like they haven't done like manager work.**

然后我就觉得，这个遣词造句不是一个 10 岁小孩能写出来的。然后我联想到我们的情境，因为我们跟很多 18 到 22 岁的年轻人打交道——他们做过实习，但没真正做过管理工作。

解析：
* **turn of a phrase** 🔥：名词短语，措辞方式、遣词造句
* **be capable of doing**：有能力做某事
* **internships** /ˈɪntɜːnʃɪps/：名词，实习

---

(6) [21:07-21:33] **Like you know we're saying, you know post product-market fit, uh once you have job queues of like millions of jobs and like you know hundreds of thousands of errors. That's like real management. Like that's really you know it's horribly unglamorous like combing through hundreds of thousands of errors and then like manually making sure that like the thing works for all of your users in the background.**

就是说在产品达到市场匹配之后，当你有上百万任务的队列、成千上万的错误要处理——那才是真正的管理。那真的是极其没有光环感的工作，就是一条条梳理几十万个报错，然后手动确保这个东西在后台能给所有用户正常运行。

解析：
* **post product-market fit** 🔥：达到产品市场匹配之后（创业术语）
* **job queues**：任务队列（技术术语）
* **unglamorous** /ʌnˈɡlæmərəs/：形容词，没有光环的、不光鲜的
* **combing through** 🔥：短语动词，仔细梳理、逐条排查

---

(7) [21:33-21:53] **How does the next generation understand that? Can the Claude Code bot actually teach people about uh architecture and things like that or you know are you just gonna bump your head into it and users just kind of suffer and you know people have to figure it out.**

下一代人怎么去理解这些？**Claude Code** 的机器人真的能教人系统架构之类的东西吗？还是说你只能自己碰壁，用户跟着受苦，然后每个人只能自己慢慢摸索？

解析：
* **bump your head into it** 🔥：短语，碰壁、吃亏才学到（类似"撞南墙"）
* **architecture** /ˈɑːkɪtektʃə/：名词，（软件）架构
* **figure it out**：弄明白、自己搞清楚

---

(8) [21:53-22:08] **Like at least where I find myself spending the most time when it comes to product is figuring out the kind of product model in a sense like what are the things that the user has to understand today and what are the primitives that they can use to like do whatever they want. I always think of Slack like this.**

至少就我自己来说，在产品方面花最多时间的是搞清楚产品模型——用户今天需要理解什么，以及有哪些基本单元他们可以用来实现任何想要的功能。我总是拿 **Slack** 来举例。

解析：
* **product model**：产品模型（产品设计中用户的心智模型）
* **primitives** /ˈprɪmɪtɪvz/ 🔥：名词，基本单元、基础构件（技术/设计术语）
* **when it comes to**：当涉及到……

---

(9) [22:08-22:30] **It's like Slack was in some ways not really a new concept. It's like there were many chats that existed before it. But the fact that they had like channels, messages, and reactions in a simple way that people could just like think about and be like, "Oh, I understand how to like navigate this." It made a lot of sense for people. But then kind of once they were there, like it's very hard to change that later on for a user, you know?**

**Slack** 在某些方面并不是一个全新的概念，在它之前已经有很多聊天工具了。但它把频道、消息和表情反应这些东西用一种简单的方式呈现出来，让人一看就懂"哦，我知道怎么用了"。这对用户来说很合理。但一旦用户习惯了这个模型，之后再想改变就很难了。

解析：
* **navigate** /ˈnævɪɡeɪt/：动词，导航、使用（引申为"搞懂如何使用"）
* **made a lot of sense**：很有道理、很合理
* **once they were there**：一旦他们习惯了

---

(10) [22:30-22:49] **It's like, oh, maybe they wanted to go in more of like a document first way or like maybe right now they're trying to incorporate agents. It's like difficult to change the user's mental model. And so I at least for myself building products it's like you have to think about that very carefully from an early stage because again whatever you supply to the coding agents as that kind of kernel is going to be what they run with and make more of forever more.**

比如也许他们后来想走文档优先的路线，或者现在想融入 AI 代理。要改变用户的心智模型太难了。所以至少对我来说做产品，你必须从早期阶段就非常仔细地思考这个问题，因为你提供给编程代理的那个内核，就是它们会一直沿用并不断扩展的东西。

解析：
* **mental model** 🔥：名词短语，心智模型（用户对产品的理解框架）
* **incorporate** /ɪnˈkɔːpəreɪt/：动词，融合、纳入
* **kernel** /ˈkɜːnl/：名词，核心、内核
* **run with**：沿用、采纳并推进

---

(11) [23:01-23:18] **Do you have thoughts just cuz you know the agent so well? Like what types of engineers are going to benefit more than others from these tools becoming popular? In general, I think that kind of the more senior you are, the more you benefit.**

你对代理工具这么了解，有什么想法吗？哪些类型的工程师会从这些工具的普及中受益更多？总体来说，我觉得你越资深，受益就越大。

解析：
* **benefit from** /ˈbenɪfɪt/：从……中受益
* **the more... the more...**：越……越……（比较级并列结构）

---

(12) [23:18-23:43] **Because the agents are so good at taking some sort of idea and then putting it into action. If you're able to prompt that in a few words, it's kind of like, oh, now suddenly I had this like idea. I find this so often scrolling through the codebase. It's like, oh, like here's a thing that I wish were different. Here's a thing that I wish were different. Like just being able to kick those off and then have them come back I think is super empowering and multiplies your impact.**

因为代理工具非常擅长把某个想法变成行动。如果你能用几个词就把它描述出来，就会像——突然之间我有了这个想法。我在浏览代码库时经常遇到这种感觉："这里我希望能改一下，那里也想改一下。"能把这些任务启动然后让它们自己跑完回来，我觉得这太赋能了，能成倍放大你的影响力。

解析：
* **put it into action**：付诸行动
* **kick off** 🔥：短语动词，启动、开始
* **empowering** /ɪmˈpaʊərɪŋ/：形容词，赋能的、让人感到有力量的
* **multiplies your impact**：成倍放大你的影响力

---

(13) [23:43-24:02] **I think also being able to detect like which sorts of changes are good or bad architecturally is very important or like have a sense for where you might want to flag something to an agent. I think engineers who are more organized, like managerish, and there's probably just a missing product to be built here. Maybe something like Conductor where it's like spread across all of your sessions.**

我觉得能够判断哪些架构层面的改动是好是坏也非常重要，或者说要有一种直觉知道什么时候该给代理打标记。我觉得那些更有组织能力、更像管理者的工程师会受益更多。这里可能还缺一个产品，也许类似 **Conductor** 那样的东西，能跨你所有的会话来管理。

解析：
* **architecturally** /ˌɑːkɪˈtektʃərəli/：副词，在架构层面上
* **flag something**：标记某事（引起注意）
* **managerish**：形容词（口语造词），像管理者的
* **Conductor**：指一种可能的产品概念

---

(14) [24:02-24:18] **And kind of reminding you like hey you were working on this thing it's done it needs your input here. Oh you should switch your attention over to this other thing. I think that is — Conductor should add that — yeah like context management for agents but like we also need context management for humans. Yes 100%.**

提醒你"嘿，你之前在做这个东西，做完了，这里需要你的意见。哦，你应该把注意力转到另一件事上。"我觉得 **Conductor** 应该加上这个——对，代理需要上下文管理，但我们人类也需要上下文管理。完全同意。

解析：
* **context management** 🔥：上下文管理（AI/产品术语）
* **switch your attention**：转移注意力
* **input**：名词，这里指意见、决策输入

---

(15) [24:18-24:36] **Yeah. I mean I want like when I wake up every day it kind of is like hey here's all the work that got done overnight. Like here are the like three decisions that you need to make. Here are like areas of deep thinking that you were planning to do. Like I want the turn by turn for my day.**

是啊。我希望每天醒来就能看到：嘿，这是昨晚完成的所有工作。这是你需要做的三个决定。这些是你计划要深度思考的领域。我想要那种逐步导航式的一天安排。

解析：
* **overnight**：副词，在夜间、过夜期间
* **turn by turn** 🔥：逐步导航的（来自地图导航术语，GPS turn-by-turn navigation）
* **deep thinking**：深度思考

---

(16) [24:36-24:56] **You know other things that make it very useful, like if you're able to build some sort of like quick prototype for an idea to show it off. Like that's an area, I mean obviously the agents do super well at this. I would find myself at OpenAI often writing kind of like prototype code or like hey I've got this like in-memory key value store can you now turn it into like work with a production database or something like that.**

还有其他让它很有用的地方，比如你能快速搭一个原型来展示想法——代理在这方面显然做得非常好。我在 **OpenAI** 的时候经常写原型代码，比如"我有这个内存键值存储，你能把它改成用生产数据库的吗？"之类的。

解析：
* **show it off**：展示、炫耀
* **in-memory key value store**：内存键值存储（技术术语）
* **production database**：生产数据库（技术术语）

---

(17) [24:56-25:10] **Being able to concisely specify ideas in code and I think having a smell for what the right architecture is is still the area where the models like don't do the best job. So if you were going back to your like college days and studying CS again fresh and you like were picking your own like syllabus or curriculum like what would you study?**

能够用代码简洁地表达想法——而且我觉得对正确架构的直觉仍然是模型做得不够好的地方。那如果你回到大学时代，重新从零学计算机科学，自己选课程大纲的话，你会学什么？

解析：
* **concisely** /kənˈsaɪsli/：副词，简洁地
* **have a smell for** 🔥：短语，对……有直觉/嗅觉（类似 "code smell" 的引申用法）
* **syllabus** /ˈsɪləbəs/：名词，教学大纲
* **curriculum** /kəˈrɪkjʊləm/：名词，课程体系

---

(18) [25:16-25:33] **Personally, I think still understanding systems is very important. And just having some conception of like how like git works, you know, or like HTTP or databases, like queues, like all of these different systems. I think that those fundamentals are still quite important.**

就我个人来说，我觉得理解系统仍然非常重要。对 **git** 怎么工作、**HTTP**、数据库、队列这些不同系统有基本概念——这些基础知识仍然相当重要。

解析：
* **conception** /kənˈsepʃn/：名词，概念、理解
* **fundamentals** /ˌfʌndəˈmentlz/：名词（复数），基础知识、基本原理
* **queues** /kjuːz/：名词，队列（技术术语）

---

(19) [25:33-25:57] **The other thing that I'd probably do is just have a semester where like each week you're just building something and you really try and push the models as far as they can go. There's a sense that you have whenever you're doing something that you could always just like go up the layer and ask the model to do it. You know, where it's like, oh, I have like an implement command where it like implements the next phase of the plan, but then I could have like an implement all command and it like goes stage by stage and creates a new sub agent.**

另一件事是用一个学期，每周做一个项目，真正把模型推到极限。你在做事的时候总有一种感觉——总是可以再往上一层让模型来做。比如你有一个"执行"命令来实现计划的下一步，但然后你可以有一个"全部执行"命令，让它一步步走并创建新的子代理。

解析：
* **semester** /sɪˈmestə/：名词，学期
* **go up the layer**：往上一层抽象（编程概念）
* **sub agent**：子代理（AI 代理架构术语）
* **stage by stage**：一步一步地

---

(20) [25:57-26:16] **And then I could have like a check your work kind of thing. And I think knowing where the models can and can't accomplish that is such a moving target that it's worthwhile just to like tinker a lot. I mean, the other thing that's really really crazy is — I mean, I would love to be able to teach 18 to 22 year olds.**

然后还可以有个"检查你的工作"之类的功能。我觉得了解模型能做什么不能做什么，这个边界变化太快了，所以值得多去动手折腾。另一件让我觉得很疯狂的事是——我真的很想能去教 18 到 22 岁的年轻人。

解析：
* **moving target** 🔥：名词短语，移动的靶子（比喻不断变化的事物）
* **worthwhile** /ˌwɜːθˈwaɪl/：形容词，值得的
* **tinker** /ˈtɪŋkə/ 🔥：动词，折腾、捣鼓、动手尝试

---

(21) [26:16-26:39] **Like, everyone around at this table has shipped stuff that people really really want and love. So, it's like how do we teach people that? I wonder if like the best 18 to 22 year olds like 5 years from now will just have like off the charts taste and everything because they'll just be so much more prolific. They should be, right? Like they should just be launching and like touching reality like 10 times as much as like the generation before them.**

这桌上每个人都发布过人们真正想要和喜爱的产品。那我们怎么教别人做到这一点？我在想，5 年后最优秀的 18 到 22 岁年轻人是不是品味会直接爆表，因为他们会高产得多。应该是这样吧？他们应该比上一代人多 10 倍地去发布产品、接触现实。

解析：
* **shipped stuff** 🔥：发布过产品（"ship" 在科技圈指发布/上线）
* **off the charts**：短语，超出图表范围、爆表（形容程度极高）
* **prolific** /prəˈlɪfɪk/：形容词，高产的、多产的
* **touching reality**：接触现实（指真实用户反馈）

---

(22) [26:39-27:00] **The one thing I have wondered about on that note, I don't know if you all found this, but growing up my mom used to tell me like, oh, like stop multitasking. You're not paying attention to like what I'm doing. And I think there is some truth to that. Like often I would be like off on my computer like not paying attention. But I do think I was legitimately better at multitasking than our parents were.**

关于这点我一直在想——不知道你们有没有这种感觉——小时候我妈总跟我说"别一心多用了，你根本没在注意我说什么。"这话确实有道理，我经常在电脑前走神不听她说话。但我确实觉得我的多任务能力比我们父母那代人要强。

解析：
* **multitasking** /ˌmʌltiˈtɑːskɪŋ/：名词/动名词，多任务处理
* **legitimately** /lɪˈdʒɪtɪmətli/：副词，确实地、真正地
* **on that note** 🔥：短语，说到这个话题

---

(23) [27:00-27:22] **And now I look at this new generation. I think they're actually quite a bit better at multitasking than we are, you know, because they've kind of grown up in this age of the internet and they're dealing with like TikTok and all these like different short form video and things. Like it seems like there's room for both kind of this like deep thinking where you want to like notice what you're seeing and understand and problem solve, but then there's also this mode of just like bounce between a bunch of different things and you're context switching constantly.**

再看现在的新一代，我觉得他们的多任务处理能力比我们强不少，因为他们在互联网时代长大，要应对 **TikTok** 和各种短视频。似乎两种模式都有空间——一种是深度思考、仔细观察理解和解决问题，另一种是在一堆不同事情之间来回切换、不断进行上下文切换。

解析：
* **short form video**：短视频
* **bounce between**：在……之间来回跳转
* **context switching** 🔥：上下文切换（计算机/心理学术语）

---

(24) [27:22-27:40] **ADHD mode. Yeah, the new generation is quite good at this. Yes, I definitely think there's a type of smart person, and maybe it's ADHD, but just like always has like a bunch of good projects on the go, but just never actually finishes anything. I might relate to this personality a little bit.**

**ADHD** 模式。对，新一代确实很擅长这个。是的，我绝对觉得有一种聪明人——也许就是 **ADHD** 型的——总是手头有一堆很好的项目在做，但就是永远都完不成。我可能有点对号入座了。

解析：
* **ADHD**：注意力缺陷多动障碍（Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder）
* **on the go** 🔥：短语，在进行中的
* **relate to**：产生共鸣、对号入座

---

(25) [27:40-27:56] **You release your vibe code. Yeah, but I wouldn't — only because of Claude Code. That's kind of my — like now I just think like you kind of like there's certain types of brains that just have like 10 branches going in their head, but you never have enough hours in the day to actually like see any of them through. So, they're always like half complete.**

你发了你的 vibe code。是啊，但如果没有 **Claude Code** 我不会这样——现在我的想法是，有些人的大脑里同时有 10 条分支在跑，但你永远没有足够的时间去把任何一条做完。所以它们永远都是半成品。

解析：
* **vibe code**：氛围编程（一种依赖 AI 辅助的轻松编程方式）
* **branches**：名词，分支（这里比喻脑中的多条想法线）
* **see them through** 🔥：短语动词，把它们做到底、坚持完成

---

(26) [27:56-28:14] **And now it's just like Claude Code gets you over the line with everything. And it's just like, and you made this point in your blog post about how it feels like a video game, but it's just like there's just a constant novelty factor. Like you start working on something and usually when you hit the point of like I'm bored and I've got like this other better idea and I should like start on that and then come back to this. Like you can do that now, but like everything can actually get finished.**

现在 **Claude Code** 能帮你把每件事都做过终点线。你在博客里也提到过这一点——它就像玩电子游戏一样，有一种持续的新鲜感。当你做一件事做到觉得无聊、想到另一个更好的点子想先去做那个——你现在可以这样做了，而且每件事都能真的做完。

解析：
* **get you over the line** 🔥：帮你跨过终点线（完成某事的关键最后一步）
* **novelty factor** /ˈnɒvlti/：新鲜感因素
* **hit the point**：到达某个节点

---

(27) [28:14-28:32] **Let's live in the future for a moment. It's 40 years from now. Software still exists. Databases still exist. Access control still exists. But like at the core of it, I mean software is entirely personal. Access control and who gets to do it is like you know sort of like this manager mode thing that people still have meetings about.**

让我们畅想一下未来。40 年后，软件仍然存在，数据库仍然存在，访问控制仍然存在。但在核心层面，软件完全是个人化的了。访问控制和谁能做什么，仍然是人们需要开会讨论的"管理模式"。

解析：
* **access control**：访问控制（技术/安全术语）
* **at the core of it**：在其核心层面
* **live in the future**：畅想未来（字面意思是"活在未来"）

---

(28) [28:32-28:55] **But then everything else about a company, its functions, its rules, is defined by people just doing things in their own Claude Code like thing. I don't know maybe it's a CLI or it's like you know having giant armies of workers. Then I don't know what would that look like. Like imagine if every time a company signed up for Segment you fork the codebase, you give them their own copy of Segment running on their own servers.**

但公司的其他一切——它的功能、它的规则——都由人们在自己的 **Claude Code** 类工具里操作来定义。也许是 CLI，也许像是拥有大量工作者军团。想象一下，每次一家公司注册 **Segment**，你就把代码库 fork 一份，给他们一个运行在自己服务器上的 **Segment** 副本。

解析：
* **fork the codebase** 🔥：复制代码库（开源/版本控制术语）
* **CLI**：命令行界面（Command Line Interface）
* **Segment**：一个客户数据平台产品

---

(29) [28:55-29:17] **And then if they want to change anything about it they just like tell some chat window which is running like an agent coding loop and just like edits their version of Segment. As Segment the corporation pushes out more features some agent figures out how to merge. Yeah I could totally see it. I mean sort of what I've been thinking — I don't know how far this future is — but like eventually every person who's working has their own sort of like cloud computer and set of cloud agents who are running for them.**

然后如果他们想改任何东西，就在聊天窗口告诉正在运行编程代理循环的工具去修改他们那个版本。当 **Segment** 公司推出新功能时，某个代理会想办法合并。对，我完全能想象。我一直在想——不知道这个未来有多远——但最终每个工作中的人都会有自己的云端电脑和一组云端代理在为他们运行。

解析：
* **agent coding loop**：代理编程循环
* **pushes out**：推出（新功能/更新）
* **figures out how to merge**：想办法合并（代码合并）

---

(30) [29:23-29:45] **And they're mostly just like talking back and forth. It's kind of like having like a super EA or something where it's like, "Oh, here are the things I need to pay attention to. Let me make some quick decisions. Let me spend more time on this. Let me meet with other people." Cuz I think that there's still going to be room for people who want to meet other people and exchange ideas in person. At least I get a lot of fulfillment out of that.**

而且大部分时间他们只是来回对话。就像拥有一个超级行政助理——"这些是我需要关注的事情。让我做几个快速决定。让我在这件事上多花点时间。让我去跟其他人见面。"因为我觉得面对面交流和交换想法仍然会有需求。至少我从中获得很多满足感。

解析：
* **EA** (Executive Assistant) 🔥：行政助理
* **fulfillment** /fʊlˈfɪlmənt/：名词，满足感、成就感
* **exchange ideas in person**：面对面交换想法

---

(31) [29:45-30:02] **And then separately, there's going to be this army of agents who are doing things on your behalf and automating a bunch of things. I think the average company is probably going to get like a little smaller and there's going to be many more of them doing more things. Something I'm curious to see is kind of like what the updated version of the PG maker schedule versus manager schedule would look like.**

另外还会有一大群代理在替你做事、自动化各种工作。我觉得普通公司可能会变小一些，但数量会更多，做更多的事情。我很好奇的是，**PG** 那篇关于"制造者日程 vs 管理者日程"的文章的升级版会是什么样的。

解析：
* **on your behalf** 🔥：代表你、替你
* **PG**：指 **Paul Graham**，YC 创始人
* **maker schedule vs manager schedule** 🔥：制造者日程 vs 管理者日程（PG 经典文章中的概念）

---

(32) [30:02-30:24] **Cuz I feel like part of what's going on at YC is sort of a lot of our jobs are essentially manager schedule which just really made it hard to do any sort of building your own software. But now you totally can and that's why like a bunch of the partners just do it in the meeting. Like I — like right at the beginning of this podcast. You let it run and then come back. Well, like in the pockets, right?**

因为我觉得 **YC** 现在的情况是我们很多工作本质上是管理者日程，这让自己写代码变得很难。但现在完全可以了，这就是为什么很多合伙人在开会时就直接写代码——就像这期播客一开始那样。你让它跑着，然后回来看。就像在碎片时间里做。

解析：
* **YC** (Y Combinator)：著名创业孵化器
* **partners**：合伙人
* **in the pockets**：在碎片时间里、在间隙中

---

(33) [30:24-30:47] **Like it just used to be like literally unless you had like, you know, 4 hours minimum block free to do something, it just wasn't worth even getting started, right? And I think that actually goes very deep to how we've changed programming. Like it used to be that in order to write any code, you had to fill your own context window with so much data about all the different class names and the functions and the code that it touches. It would take hours to build up that context window. And so doing it in 10-minute snatches was just like so frustrating.**

以前是这样的——除非你有至少 4 个小时的整块空闲时间，否则根本不值得开始。我觉得这深刻地反映了我们如何改变了编程方式。以前要写任何代码，你得把自己的"上下文窗口"塞满各种类名、函数和相关代码的信息，要花好几个小时才能建立起来。所以用 10 分钟的碎片时间来写代码简直令人崩溃。

解析：
* **context window** 🔥：上下文窗口（这里既是 AI 术语也是比喻人脑的工作记忆）
* **snatches** /snætʃɪz/：名词（复数），碎片时间、零星时段
* **build up**：建立起来、积累

---

(34) [30:47-31:11] **I do think maybe one primitive for this future world will be — I think still the data models need to be consistent and the system of record — there's opportunity for something that's kind of agentic first. Because right now we're still kind of integrated very much with databases and SQL or NoSQL queries that are very low level. But imagine something that generates all the data that you need for all the different views for custom software.**

我觉得未来世界的一个基础构件可能是——数据模型仍然需要保持一致，记录系统也是——有机会做一个"代理优先"的东西。因为现在我们仍然深度依赖数据库和非常底层的 **SQL** 或 **NoSQL** 查询。但想象一下，有个东西能为定制软件的所有不同视图自动生成你需要的所有数据。

解析：
* **system of record**：记录系统（权威数据源）
* **agentic first** 🔥：代理优先的（AI 代理原生设计的）
* **low level**：底层的（技术术语）

---

(35) [31:11-31:36] **So a lot of the world would be custom views but I think the unified stuff — we still need to have data to be correct. I think data has a lot of gravity. And I think you see this with companies who are like offering access via API or MCP. Like I think Slack locked down their API a little bit because they didn't want people just exfiltrating everything from Slack and then building agentic experiences on top of it.**

大部分世界会是定制视图，但统一的那些部分——我们仍然需要数据是正确的。数据有很大的引力。你看那些通过 **API** 或 **MCP** 提供访问的公司就知道了——**Slack** 收紧了他们的 **API**，因为他们不想让人把所有东西从 **Slack** 里抽走然后在上面构建代理体验。

解析：
* **gravity** 🔥：引力、重力（比喻数据的"粘性"和重要性）
* **locked down**：锁定、收紧（限制访问）
* **exfiltrating** /ˌeksˈfɪltreɪtɪŋ/：动词，窃取数据、数据外泄
* **MCP** (Model Context Protocol)：模型上下文协议

(36) [31:36-32:06] **I wonder with that note if you were to rebuild Segment in the current with the current tools how would it look like? I mean, Segment is a funny business in that where we started was building these integrations, right? And so it's like, oh, you need to wire up the same data going to like Mixpanel and Kissmetrics and Google Analytics, etc. And I think just writing that code now — like that used to be maybe a more annoying or harder thing to do and so it was worth paying for. Now that value has dropped to zero.**

说到这个，如果你用现在的工具重新做 **Segment** 会是什么样？**Segment** 是个有意思的生意，因为我们一开始是做集成的。就是你需要把同一份数据接到 **Mixpanel**、**Kissmetrics**、**Google Analytics** 等等。以前写那些代码比较烦、比较难，所以值得花钱买。现在那个价值已经归零了。

解析：
* **integrations** /ˌɪntɪˈɡreɪʃnz/：名词，集成、接入
* **wire up** 🔥：短语动词，接线、连接（技术术语，把数据管道接起来）
* **dropped to zero**：降到零

---

(37) [32:06-32:29] **Yeah. And actually in many cases you're better off saying, "Oh, I actually want to map it this way and I want this specific behavior." Like I will just tell Claude or Codex what to do and then it will do it and I'll have exactly the behavior that I want. So I think that aspect of Segment, the value has dropped precipitously. I think the aspect of keeping this data pipeline running and continuing to automate a bunch of parts of your business — that value is kind of still there.**

对。实际上很多情况下你自己说"我想这样映射数据，我要这个特定行为"会更好。你直接告诉 **Claude** 或 **Codex** 该怎么做，它就会做，你得到的正是你想要的行为。所以 **Segment** 那方面的价值已经急剧下降了。但保持数据管道运行、持续自动化业务各个环节的价值还在。

解析：
* **precipitously** /prɪˈsɪpɪtəsli/ 🔥：副词，急剧地、断崖式地
* **data pipeline**：数据管道（数据处理流程）
* **map**：动词，映射（数据映射）

---

(38) [32:29-32:59] **Or like schedule these email deliveries which should go out through Customer.io every time a customer signs up or manage audiences for you. Like that value is kind of still there and I think you could do a lot more interesting things where it's like hey if I have all this data and a full view of the customer, how should I be emailing them? Should I change parts of the product when they log in? Should I be giving them different onboardings depending on who they are? Like there's a lot more interesting stuff that you could do by basically running like small LM agents over them.**

比如安排通过 **Customer.io** 给每个新注册用户发邮件，或者管理受众群体——那些价值还在。我觉得你还能做更多有意思的事：如果我有所有这些数据和客户的全貌，我应该怎么给他们发邮件？他们登录时应该改变产品的某些部分吗？应该根据他们是谁给不同的入门引导吗？通过用小型语言模型代理来处理，能做很多更有意思的事。

解析：
* **audiences**：受众群体（营销术语）
* **onboardings**：名词，入门引导/新用户引导流程
* **LM agents** (Language Model agents)：语言模型代理

---

(39) [32:59-33:16] **That would be the changes I would make. So it's kind of like moving up the stack to your comment earlier. And all the way turtles down the low-level stuff is gone, is now really more doing things at the campaign level which is way more abstract. Yes. I mean I'm amazed at to what degree Claude Code even just from the context of what I'm working on figures out what my motivations are.**

这就是我会做的改变。就像你之前说的向上移动到更高层——底层的东西一路往下都没了，现在是在营销活动层面做事，更加抽象。是的，我很惊讶 **Claude Code** 仅仅从我正在做的事情的上下文中就能推测出我的动机。

解析：
* **moving up the stack** 🔥：向技术栈的更高层移动（技术术语，做更抽象的工作）
* **turtles all the way down**：名词短语，"一路都是乌龟"（指无限递归/层层嵌套的经典隐喻）
* **campaign level**：营销活动层面

---

(40) [33:16-33:47] **Yeah. I'm still blown away by coding agents because effectively what you're doing is you're like giving them a copy of a repo and then you're slipping a little note under the door and being like, "Hey, go implement this thing." They have no knowledge of what your company is or what you do, who your customers are in most cases. But it blows my mind that it works at all. And that's where I think the context is really important, right? Because if it latches on to something that isn't quite right, it doesn't have a lot to go on. And if it misses something that's essential, it's going to just reimplement it.**

我仍然被编程代理惊到，因为本质上你就是给它们一份代码仓库的副本，然后在门缝底下塞一张纸条说"嘿，去实现这个东西"。它们大多数情况下完全不知道你的公司是什么、做什么、客户是谁。但它居然就能用——这太令人震惊了。这就是为什么上下文如此重要。因为如果它抓住了什么不太对的东西，它没有太多其他信息可以参考。如果它遗漏了什么关键的东西，它就会直接重新实现。

解析：
* **blown away** 🔥：短语，被深深震撼
* **slipping a note under the door**：从门缝塞纸条（生动比喻）
* **latches on to** /lætʃ/：抓住、锁定
* **reimplement**：重新实现

---

(41) [33:47-34:05] **What do you think the constraints are right now? I mean, like context window is still a constraint, but it's like so big that, you know, we can do some stuff. Like we can't do the mega rearchitectures, but we can do a lot. And then if the Opus 4.5 somehow got a lot smarter, and then that unlocked a big thing, which was interesting.**

你觉得现在的限制因素是什么？上下文窗口仍然是一个限制，但它已经足够大了，我们能做很多事。做不了那种超大规模的架构重构，但能做很多。然后 **Opus 4.5** 如果变聪明了很多，就解锁了一个大突破，这很有意思。

解析：
* **constraints** /kənˈstreɪnts/：名词，限制因素、约束
* **mega rearchitectures**：超大规模架构重构
* **unlocked**：解锁（比喻突破瓶颈）

---

(42) [34:05-34:28] **I don't have no idea if that was like pre-training or post-training. Like what are there other levers that you think of other than, you know, basic model intelligence — like frontier model intelligence and context window? I mean I still think context window is like probably the number one limit.**

我完全不知道那是预训练还是后训练的功劳。除了基础模型智能——前沿模型智能和上下文窗口之外，你能想到其他什么杠杆吗？我仍然认为上下文窗口大概是第一大限制。

解析：
* **levers** /ˈliːvəz/ 🔥：名词，杠杆（比喻能推动变化的关键因素）
* **pre-training / post-training**：预训练 / 后训练（AI 模型训练阶段）
* **frontier model**：前沿模型

---

(43) [34:28-34:52] **Like if you look at Claude Code executing it's delegating to all these different context windows. At the end of the day when each one comes back it's getting some sort of summary so it's also not getting the full picture. Like if you have a problem that's just like too big to fit in a single one, kind of no amount of compaction is going to help. I would point to that as like both Anthropic has figured something quite useful out with delegating to these sub-context windows, but also I think it's still a blocker.**

你看 **Claude Code** 运行时，它在委派给各种不同的上下文窗口。最终每个子窗口返回时只是给一个摘要，所以它也没有得到完整的画面。如果一个问题大到塞不进一个上下文窗口，再怎么压缩也没用。我觉得 **Anthropic** 在委派子上下文窗口方面确实搞出了很有用的东西，但这仍然是一个瓶颈。

解析：
* **delegating** /ˈdelɪɡeɪtɪŋ/：动词，委派、分发
* **compaction** /kəmˈpækʃn/：名词，压缩、压实
* **blocker**：名词，阻碍因素、瓶颈

---

(44) [34:52-35:09] **So we'd do better if we had a million million token context every single time. Yeah, I think so. And like figure out a better way to especially train these like very long context trajectories. Because if you think about it, there's a lot of training data on the internet for like what is the next sentence that comes or like what's the next paragraph that comes.**

如果每次都有百万级甚至更大的 token 上下文窗口，我们能做得更好。是的，我也这么觉得。还需要找到更好的方法来训练这些超长上下文轨迹。因为你想想，互联网上有大量训练数据是关于"下一个句子是什么"或"下一段是什么"的。

解析：
* **trajectories** /trəˈdʒektəriz/：名词，轨迹（这里指模型在长上下文中的行为路径）
* **token**：标记（AI 模型处理文本的基本单位）

---

(45) [35:09-35:26] **If you have 80,000 tokens that are generated, understanding what the next thing to do based upon like oh I should refer to the 20,000th token — that's trickier. I think this integration and orchestration is starting to become the limiting factor.**

如果你已经生成了 80,000 个 token，要理解下一步该做什么、比如"我应该参考第 20,000 个 token 的内容"——这就难多了。我觉得这种整合和编排正在成为限制因素。

解析：
* **orchestration** /ˌɔːkɪˈstreɪʃn/ 🔥：名词，编排、协调（技术术语，多系统/代理的协调管理）
* **refer to**：参考、引用
* **limiting factor**：限制因素

---

(46) [35:26-35:55] **I mean I think there are stuff on code review related to this. It's like oh if we're merging all this code, who's watching it? Does a human still have to watch it? How do we verify the changes? And then I think pulling in the context correctly from your tools — like you were talking about Sentry — you want Sentry to be able to auto figure out a PR and then maybe it pushes it to a subset of your traffic and if it looks good then it rolls out everywhere. Like all of that automation still has to be built.**

我觉得代码审查方面有很多相关问题。如果我们在合并所有这些代码，谁在看？人类还需要看吗？我们怎么验证这些改动？然后从你的工具中正确拉取上下文——比如你说的 **Sentry**——你希望 **Sentry** 能自动搞定一个 PR，然后把它推送给一部分流量，如果看起来没问题就全面发布。这些自动化都还需要建设。

解析：
* **code review**：代码审查
* **Sentry**：一个错误监控平台
* **PR** (Pull Request)：拉取请求
* **rolls out** 🔥：短语动词，全面推出/发布
* **a subset of your traffic**：你的一部分流量（灰度发布概念）

---

(47) [35:55-36:19] **I was surprised how important testing was. Like I was operating for the first 2 or 3 days of my 9 days in the wilderness with no tests or very few tests. And then one day I was like, "All right, today's refactor day. I'm going to get to 100% test coverage." And then I just sped up like crazy. It was just like, "Oh, it did it. It works." I rarely even have to necessarily manually test because it's like the test coverage is so good and nothing breaks.**

我很惊讶测试居然这么重要。我在那 9 天"荒野求生"的头 2-3 天是没有测试或几乎没测试的。然后有一天我说"行吧，今天是重构日，我要做到 100% 测试覆盖率。"然后我的速度就疯狂加快了。就像——"哦，它做到了，能用。"我甚至很少需要手动测试了，因为测试覆盖率太好了，什么都不会坏。

解析：
* **in the wilderness**：在荒野中（比喻独自用代理编程的沉浸式体验）
* **test coverage** 🔥：测试覆盖率
* **refactor** /ˌriːˈfæktə/：动词，重构代码
* **sped up**：加速了（speed up 的过去式）

---

(48) [36:19-36:50] **Which is very similar to what all the companies are doing just for prompt engineering outside of coding — very much test-driven development. I think we had this episode with Jake Heler and that was a big paradigm shift — the way you get a good prompt is all test driven just like evals. Right, in a sense the test cases are your evals. There are some broken flows now. I think that we might need a Claude Code that could talk to a Stack Overflow — like a Claude Code Stack Overflow. Like I had this problem. It was so crazy.**

这跟所有公司在编程之外做提示词工程时用的方法很相似——非常是测试驱动开发。我记得我们之前跟 **Jake Heler** 那期也聊过，那是一个重大范式转变——好的提示词全靠测试驱动，就像 evals 一样。对，某种意义上测试用例就是你的 evals。现在有一些流程是坏的。我觉得我们可能需要一个 **Claude Code** 版的 **Stack Overflow**。我碰到过一个问题太疯狂了。

解析：
* **test-driven development (TDD)** 🔥：测试驱动开发
* **paradigm shift** /ˈpærədaɪm/：范式转变
* **evals**：evaluations 的缩写，评估测试（AI 术语）

---

(49) [36:50-37:23] **Like I — instead of using the priority of a job queue — or actually I didn't even write this — the machine wrote a string with a comma thinking that it would take that syntax, but it was expecting an array in JSON and then no jobs would run. And then I watched it for like 30 minutes walk through the internals of Rails' active job — like a couple thousand lines of code — trying to debug what was happening and it found the bug actually.**

就是——在任务队列的优先级那里——其实这不是我写的——机器写了一个带逗号的字符串以为能接受那个语法，但实际上它需要的是 **JSON** 数组格式，然后所有任务都不运行了。然后我看着它花了 30 分钟翻遍 **Rails** 的 **Active Job** 内部——几千行代码——试图调试到底怎么回事，它居然真找到了那个 bug。

解析：
* **job queue**：任务队列
* **syntax** /ˈsɪntæks/：名词，语法格式
* **Active Job**：**Rails** 框架的后台任务系统
* **internals**：名词，内部实现、内部代码

---

(50) [37:23-37:58] **I was like that's amazing. I just think about what I would do like 10 years ago — I would have been like hey why are the jobs not working and then I would find a Stack Overflow or blog post and it's like oh yeah nobody fixed that stupid bug where you think that you can put a comma delimited string in there but actually you have to make sure it's an array. I think that's one of the hardest parts about thinking about what's going to happen here because there's things that you would do as a human in a CLI right now and that's very obvious. But even that idea of like should the agents have their own Stack Overflow?**

我当时觉得太厉害了。想想 10 年前我会怎么做——我会搜"为什么任务不运行"，然后找到一个 **Stack Overflow** 或博客帖子说"对啊，没人修那个蠢 bug，你以为可以放逗号分隔的字符串进去但其实必须用数组"。我觉得最难的一点是——现在作为人类在命令行里做的事情很明显。但代理是不是应该有自己的 **Stack Overflow**？

解析：
* **comma delimited string**：逗号分隔的字符串
* **Stack Overflow**：全球最大的编程问答网站

---

(51) [37:58-38:15] **Like if you just increase the intelligence by, you know, I don't know what you even call it, like by 10 IQ points — like 10 virtual IQ points — would it even do that? It would just be like oh yeah that's a string whatever. Yeah.**

如果你只是把智能提高——我都不知道该怎么形容——比如提高 10 个 IQ 点、10 个虚拟 IQ 点，它还会犯这种错吗？它可能直接就说"哦那是个字符串嘛，无所谓。"对。

解析：
* **virtual IQ points**：虚拟 IQ 点（比喻模型智能的提升幅度）
* **whatever**：无所谓（口语，表示轻松处理）

---

(52) [38:15-38:43] **Yeah. I think there's something very interesting here around agent memory. And Claude Code has sort of set itself up and I think Codex too by storing all your conversation history just as files. So you could imagine you give it access to a tool that can read previous conversation history. I think there's a missing piece around a lot of collaboration there. Like it'd be amazing if there was some way of smartly sharing your co-workers' prompts and you could see and be like, "Oh, I hit this thing, but actually Brian over there fixed it earlier, so the two of us can share knowledge."**

对。我觉得代理记忆这个方向非常有趣。**Claude Code** 和 **Codex** 都通过把对话历史存成文件来做这个。你可以想象给它一个工具来读取之前的对话历史。但在协作方面还有一大块缺失。如果能有某种方式智能地分享同事的提示词就太棒了，你能看到"哦，我碰到了这个问题，但那边的 Brian 之前修过了，我俩可以共享知识。"

解析：
* **agent memory** 🔥：代理记忆（AI 代理的持久化记忆能力）
* **conversation history**：对话历史
* **collaboration** /kəˌlæbəˈreɪʃn/：名词，协作

---

(53) [38:43-39:00] **I think there's something onto this of like a model generated wiki, you know, or like Graphopedia stuff. Now I can't stop thinking about — have you seen the Claudebot Social? Like the network for Claude bots to talk to each other? And it's like that's the evolution.**

我觉得那个方向上可以做模型生成的 wiki，或者类似 **Graphopedia** 那样的东西。现在我停不下来想——你看过 **Claudebot Social** 吗？就是那个让 **Claude** 机器人互相对话的网络？那就是它的进化方向。

解析：
* **wiki**：维基（协作知识库）
* **Claudebot Social**：一个让 AI 代理互相交流的社交平台

---

(54) [39:00-39:35] **Yeah. I guess what they don't know. Claudebot's essentially like your own personal AI agent that you can run on your own machine. You can download it. Do not give it access to emails would be my number one piece of advice, or probably anything. Because it's not clear how safe it is and probably a lot of people are being prompt injected by it right now. But somebody created like a site where everyone can sort of spin up their own Claudebot personal agent and then the agents can talk to each other and now there's just all this AI generated content of these personal AI agents talking to each other.**

是啊。**Claudebot** 本质上是一个你可以在自己电脑上运行的个人 AI 代理。你可以下载它。我的头号建议是别给它邮箱权限，什么权限都别给。因为它有多安全不清楚，现在可能很多人正在被提示词注入攻击。但有人创建了一个网站，每个人都可以启动自己的 **Claudebot** 个人代理，然后这些代理可以互相对话，现在就有了一大堆 AI 生成的内容——都是个人 AI 代理在互相聊天。

解析：
* **spin up** 🔥：短语动词，启动、创建实例（技术术语）
* **prompt injected**：被提示词注入攻击（AI 安全术语）
* **piece of advice**：一条建议

---

(55) [39:35-40:01] **Yeah. I mean it looks like Reddit but if Reddit were run by agents. I mean it's interesting to see like Codex's personality shine through when writing code. I would say it does most stuff that humans don't do. Kind of this AlphaGo sense where it's like oh it'll write a Python script to modify some part of the file system. I think that is very interesting and kind of alien behavior which has been learned.**

对。看起来像 **Reddit**，但如果 **Reddit** 是由代理运行的话。看到 **Codex** 写代码时流露出的个性也很有趣。我会说它做很多人类不会做的事情。有点 **AlphaGo** 的感觉——它会写一个 **Python** 脚本去修改文件系统的某个部分。这很有意思，是一种被学习出来的"外星行为"。

解析：
* **shine through**：显露出来、流露
* **AlphaGo**：谷歌的围棋 AI 程序
* **alien behavior**：外星行为（形容非人类的做事方式）

---

(56) [40:01-40:14] **But it does give these like superhuman results for me at least when debugging complex issues that I find Opus often misses. What's an example of a complex issue that you could talk about? I mean it's like concurrency or naming issues, right?**

但至少对我来说，在调试复杂问题时它确实给出了超人类的结果——那些 **Opus** 经常会遗漏的问题。能举个复杂问题的例子吗？比如并发或命名问题。

解析：
* **superhuman**：超人类的
* **concurrency** /kənˈkʌrənsi/ 🔥：名词，并发（多个进程/线程同时执行）

---

(57) [40:14-40:46] **I find the models are actually decent at concurrency. Oftentimes there's stuff where it's like, oh, there's a request that is traversing several different services. Kind of to your point about the serialization and deserialization of stuff with commas in it. It needs to track some sort of complex behavior around those or like refreshing complex UI state and Opus often will miss it if there are many files, but Codex seems to catch it. Interesting. Yeah.**

我发现模型在并发方面其实还行。经常有那种请求需要穿越好几个不同服务的情况。就像你说的序列化和反序列化带逗号的数据那种。它需要追踪那些复杂行为，或者刷新复杂的 UI 状态——**Opus** 在文件很多时经常会漏掉，但 **Codex** 似乎能捕捉到。有意思。

解析：
* **traversing** /trəˈvɜːsɪŋ/：动词，遍历、穿越
* **serialization / deserialization** 🔥：序列化/反序列化（数据格式转换）
* **UI state**：用户界面状态

---

(58) [40:46-41:05] **Prognostication about how will tools continue to evolve. It's very interesting like I feel like sort of a new citizen in this land in a way. Like I just knew it was happening. Manager schedule, finally a project appeared and I was like oh I'm going to go all in on this and then now I'm like in it. It's like a stranger in a strange land but it resembles exactly what I remember.**

关于工具将如何继续进化的预测。很有意思，我感觉自己像是这片新大陆的新公民。我知道这一切正在发生，管理者日程嘛，终于出现了一个项目，我就说"我要全力投入"，然后现在我深陷其中。像是异乡异客，但这里跟我记忆中的完全一样。

解析：
* **prognostication** /prɒɡˌnɒstɪˈkeɪʃn/：名词，预测、预言
* **go all in**：全力投入
* **stranger in a strange land** 🔥：异乡异客（出自《圣经》和同名科幻小说）

---

(59) [41:05-41:37] **I think we all feel that way. I think the most important thing is just to keep tinkering because it all changes every few months. I do feel like the best or the people who will get the most out of coding agents in the future are going to be kind of more manager-like where they're focusing on directing flows in certain ways. They're probably going to be a little bit more like designer-artist in some ways where it's like they're figuring out what specifically goes in the product and what stuff you can do without.**

我觉得我们都有这种感觉。最重要的是持续动手折腾，因为几个月就全变了。我觉得未来从编程代理中受益最多的人会更像管理者——专注于引导工作流。他们可能也会更像设计师-艺术家——搞清楚产品里到底要什么、可以去掉什么。

解析：
* **tinkering**：动手折腾、捣鼓
* **directing flows**：引导工作流
* **do without**：不要、省去

---

(60) [41:37-42:03] **And I think they'll be very good at just like continuing to think about automation and where they're missing context. I guess what's funny is I tried to use Codex just now for my Rails project but the thing is like it's kind of obvious that nobody at OpenAI cares about Rails, which is fine. Like it's a very — it's a vestigial language. It's very strange. It just happened to be the one that I really went deep on 10 years ago.**

而且我觉得他们会非常擅长持续思考自动化和哪里还缺少上下文。有趣的是我刚才试着用 **Codex** 做我的 **Rails** 项目，但很明显 **OpenAI** 没人关心 **Rails**，这没关系。这是一种——算是遗存语言。很奇怪，只是碰巧 10 年前我深入学了它。

解析：
* **vestigial** /veˈstɪdʒiəl/ 🔥：形容词，退化的、残余的（生物学术语用于比喻）
* **went deep on**：深入研究了

---

(61) [42:03-42:36] **And then it's just funny how much of it is exactly — again anyone can make something but then the something people want is very hard. And even when you have unlimited resources at an OpenAI, it's like — I guess if someone from Codex is watching right now, my request would be go down the list of all of the runtimes and just add syntactic sugar. There's like probably 10 PRs at most for the top 15 runtimes. I guess it's sort of the reminder that man actually there are far fewer excuses for software that doesn't quite work for a user now than ever actually.**

然后很有趣的是——再次说明，谁都能做点东西，但做出人们真正想要的东西非常难。即使你在 **OpenAI** 有无限资源——如果 **Codex** 的人在看这个视频，我的请求是：把所有运行时的列表过一遍，加上语法糖。对于最常用的 15 个运行时可能最多也就 10 个 PR。这提醒我们，现在软件做得不好用的借口比以往任何时候都少了。

解析：
* **syntactic sugar** 🔥：语法糖（编程术语，让代码更易读的语法简写）
* **runtimes**：运行时环境
* **PR** (Pull Request)：拉取请求

---

(62) [42:36-43:03] **Yeah, I do think this is an interesting point in terms of mix of training data. Codex works very well on Python monorepos — the shape of OpenAI. And it's like I remember working internally at OpenAI, like oh my gosh this tool is amazing. It is incredible. And it kind of makes sense in terms of the data mix and the researchers who are working on it. I think Anthropic is focused a little bit more on some of the front-end things.**

对，从训练数据的配比角度来看这很有意思。**Codex** 在 **Python** 单体仓库上工作得非常好——正好是 **OpenAI** 的形态。我记得在 **OpenAI** 内部使用时就觉得天哪这工具太棒了。从数据配比和研究人员的角度来看这说得通。我觉得 **Anthropic** 更侧重前端方面。

解析：
* **monorepos** /ˈmɒnəʊriːpəʊz/ 🔥：名词，单体仓库（一个仓库管理多个项目）
* **data mix**：数据配比（训练数据的组成比例）

---

(63) [43:03-43:43] **And I don't know in terms of like a Ruby for example, who has the best model there and who's incorporated the data mix. Yeah. Like some of the labs tend to take this perspective of just more data is better and they'll just flood as much data as possible while others are a little bit more tuned in terms of the mix. And I think depending on which approach you take there, it can give very different results. Like taking just the top 10% of JavaScript is pretty different than looking across everything. I actually think OpenAI and the OpenAI models are really good at Ruby from what I can tell and then it's the harness around the model.**

比如 **Ruby** 方面，我不知道谁的模型最好、谁的数据配比做得好。有些实验室倾向于"数据越多越好"直接灌大量数据，而其他一些在配比上更精细。不同的方法会带来非常不同的结果——只用 **JavaScript** 最好的 10% 跟用所有数据完全不一样。据我所知 **OpenAI** 的模型在 **Ruby** 方面其实很好，问题出在模型周围的工具链上。

解析：
* **harness** /ˈhɑːnɪs/ 🔥：名词，工具链/框架（围绕模型的外层系统）
* **tuned**：调优的、精细调整的
* **flood**：动词，大量灌入

---

(64) [43:43-44:06] **It is. Yeah. Oh, interesting. It's literally like Rails has this weird thing where you have to access Postgres in a certain way or like it couldn't fit. Yeah. The sandboxing. Yeah, the sandboxing. It's such an interesting question because I think OpenAI actually takes the sandboxing and security question more seriously than almost anyone else. I remember when we were building Codex, basically one of the gates that you have to pass through in order to release a model is you have to talk about safety and security risks every time you want to release.**

确实是。**Rails** 有个怪问题，你必须用特定方式访问 **Postgres** 不然就塞不进去。对，沙箱的问题。沙箱确实是个很有趣的问题，我觉得 **OpenAI** 在沙箱和安全问题上比几乎任何人都认真。我记得我们做 **Codex** 的时候，每次要发布模型之前都必须过一道关——讨论安全和安全风险。

解析：
* **sandboxing** 🔥：沙箱化（在隔离环境中运行代码的安全技术）
* **Postgres** (PostgreSQL)：一种流行的开源数据库
* **gates**：名词，关卡、必须通过的审核步骤

(65) [44:06-44:40] **One of the things we were looking into was prompt injection especially for opening up to the internet because a bunch of users were like oh this has to work on the internet. We're like, "Oh, we don't know. It seems pretty easy to prompt." Operator was also — yeah. And so the PM on our team, Alex, basically put together a GitHub issue and it had a very obvious prompt injection, which was like, "Oh, reveal this thing." And then he told the model, "Hey, go fix this issue." And he's like, "Oh, there's no way this is going to work." And like immediately the prompt injection works, you know?**

我们研究的一个问题是提示词注入，特别是开放互联网访问——很多用户说这东西必须能上网。我们说"我们不确定，感觉挺容易被注入的"。**Operator** 也遇到了这个问题。我们团队的 PM **Alex** 做了一个 **GitHub** issue，里面放了一个很明显的提示词注入——"把这个东西泄露出来"。然后他让模型"去修这个 issue"。他说"这不可能成功的吧"。结果提示词注入立刻就成功了。

解析：
* **prompt injection** 🔥：提示词注入（AI 安全漏洞，通过恶意文本操控模型行为）
* **Operator**：**OpenAI** 的一个浏览器自动化产品
* **PM** (Product Manager)：产品经理

(66) [44:40-44:58] **And so I think OpenAI sort of correctly is very worried about this and is like, "Hey, we're going to run everything in a sandbox. We're going to make sure it doesn't touch all these sensitive files in your machine. We're going to be very careful about secrets." And I think if you're a startup where you're just running fast, you probably don't care. You're just like, I just want it to work.**

所以 **OpenAI** 对此非常担心是对的——"我们要在沙箱里运行所有东西，确保它不碰你机器上的敏感文件，对密钥非常小心。"但如果你是一个追求速度的创业公司，你可能不在乎，你只是想让它能跑就行。

解析：
* **sandbox**：沙箱（隔离的安全运行环境）
* **sensitive files**：敏感文件
* **secrets**：密钥、机密信息（技术术语）

(67) [44:58-45:22] **You know, are you a "dangerously skip permissions" person? I actually am not. I have a set of things that are — How about you? Are you running? No, I like to read, you know. I like to read what it's doing. Are you skip permissions, Jerry? 100%. YOLO. Oh my god. It's about 50/50 on the YC engineering team. A security engineer would watch this part and say, "You can't release this part of the video. Just cut it from the podcast."**

你是那种"危险地跳过权限确认"的人吗？我其实不是，我有一套——你呢？你是吗？不，我喜欢看它在做什么。**Jerry** 你跳过权限吗？百分百跳过。YOLO。天哪。**YC** 工程团队大概一半一半。安全工程师看到这段会说"你们不能放这段出来，把这段从播客里剪掉。"

解析：
* **skip permissions** 🔥：跳过权限确认（编程代理工具中的一个选项）
* **YOLO**：You Only Live Once，只活一次（表示不管后果冲就完了）

(68) [45:22-45:44] **I think it's context dependent. Like if you're at an enterprise, you don't want to do that. If you're a startup and have nothing to lose, you probably do. YC has progressed a little bit from a startup. We still act like one though, which is, I think, important. Cool. I mean, this is so awesome. Calvin, thank you so much for joining us. Of course. Thanks for having me. Oh my god. So fun. All right, back to Claude.**

我觉得这取决于场景。如果你在大企业，你不会这么做。如果你是创业公司没什么可失去的，你可能会。**YC** 已经不完全是创业公司了，但我们仍然像一个创业公司那样做事，我觉得这很重要。好啦，这太棒了。**Calvin**，非常感谢你来参加。当然，感谢邀请。天哪太好玩了。好的，回到 **Claude**。

解析：
* **context dependent**：取决于场景/语境的
* **enterprise**：名词，大企业
* **progressed from**：从……发展过来的
