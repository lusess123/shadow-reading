(1) [0:00-0:10] **I feel like when I'm using Claude Code, it's like, oh, I feel like I'm flying through the code. When it's in your CLI, this thing can debug nested delayed jobs like five levels in and figure out what the bug was and then write a test for it and it never happens again.**

我觉得用 **Claude Code** 的时候，就像在代码中飞翔一样。当它在你的 **CLI** 里运行时，这东西能深入五层嵌套的延迟任务来调试，找出 bug 是什么，然后为它写一个测试，让这个问题再也不会出现。

解析：
* **flying through the code**：短语，在代码中飞速穿梭（形容使用体验流畅高效）
* **nested delayed jobs** 🔥：嵌套的延迟任务（后端开发术语，指层层嵌套的异步队列任务）
* **five levels in**：深入五层（强调嵌套深度）
* **figure out**：短语，弄清楚、搞明白

---

(2) [0:10-0:28] **This is insane. I think everyone who's experimenting with this stuff on like a hobbyist level or at like a very small startup, they're just pushing the coding agents as far as they can go because it's like you don't really have time to figure out anything else. Like as a startup, you have limited runway. You're just going to orient around speed.**

这太疯狂了。我觉得所有在业余爱好层面或者在很小的初创公司里尝试这些东西的人，都在把编码代理的能力推到极限，因为你真的没有时间去研究别的东西。作为一个初创公司，你的资金跑道是有限的，你只能围绕速度来做决策。

解析：
* **insane**：形容词，疯狂的、不可思议的（口语中表示震惊和赞叹）
* **hobbyist** /ˈhɒbiɪst/：名词，业余爱好者
* **pushing... as far as they can go** 🔥：把……推到极限
* **runway** 🔥：名词，（创业语境下）资金跑道，指公司在资金耗尽前还能运营的时间
* **orient around**：短语，围绕……来调整方向

---

(3) [0:28-0:44] **I think at a bigger company you have a lot more to lose. What are some of the tips to become a top 1% user of coding agents? Yeah. What's your stack?**

我觉得在大公司你有更多东西可能会失去。那么，成为编码代理的前 1% 用户有什么秘诀呢？嗯，你的技术栈是什么？

解析：
* **have a lot more to lose**：短语，有更多可能失去的东西（暗示风险更大）
* **top 1% user** 🔥：前 1% 的用户（顶尖用户）
* **stack**：名词，技术栈（指开发者使用的技术工具组合）

(4) [0:44-1:02] **Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of the Light Cone. Garry, are you ready to record? I'm in plan mode right now, but okay. Yeah, I guess it's time. Sorry about that. Well, welcome to another episode of the Light Cone. And today we have an incredible guest, Kelvin French-Owen. He's one of the first people to create Codex at OpenAI and before that he started Segment, which is multi-billion dollar company that got to a very successful exit.**

大家好，欢迎回到 **Light Cone** 节目的新一期。**Garry**，你准备好录音了吗？我现在还在 plan mode 里，但好吧，我猜是时候了，抱歉。好的，欢迎来到 **Light Cone** 的又一期节目。今天我们请到了一位非常厉害的嘉宾 **Kelvin French-Owen**。他是最早在 **OpenAI** 创建 **Codex** 的人之一，在此之前他创办了 **Segment**，一家价值数十亿美元的公司，并且成功退出了。

解析：
* **episode** /ˈepɪsoʊd/：名词，（节目的）一期、一集
* **plan mode**：计划模式（双关语，既指 **Claude Code** 的 plan 模式，也指日常计划状态）
* **incredible** /ɪnˈkredɪbl/：形容词，令人难以置信的、很棒的
* **multi-billion dollar**：价值数十亿美元的
* **exit** 🔥：名词，退出（创业术语，指公司被收购或上市）

(5) [1:13-1:33] **Kelvin, welcome back. Thanks for having me. I guess what a crazy time for all of us. I recently got very very addicted to Claude Code and I would describe it as like 10 years ago I was a marathon runner and I love doing it and then I suffered a catastrophic knee injury which is called manager mode and I stopped coding which is tragic and horrible.**

**Kelvin**，欢迎回来。谢谢邀请我。对我们所有人来说，这真是个疯狂的时代。我最近非常非常沉迷于 **Claude Code**，我会这样形容：十年前我是个马拉松跑者，我热爱跑步，但后来我遭受了一次灾难性的膝盖损伤——叫做"管理者模式"——然后我就不写代码了，这真是又悲惨又可怕。

解析：
* **addicted to** /əˈdɪktɪd/：短语，沉迷于、上瘾于
* **catastrophic** /ˌkætəˈstrɒfɪk/ 🔥：形容词，灾难性的
* **knee injury → manager mode**：比喻，把"不再写代码转去当管理者"比作"膝盖受伤不能跑步"
* **tragic** /ˈtrædʒɪk/：形容词，悲惨的

---

(6) [1:33-1:56] **But now the last nine days have been like this incredible unlock of all the things I remember being able to do and it's like you know I got a new total knee replacement and actually it's a bionic knee and it allows me to run five times faster. What's your take on it? Because you're right out there at the forefront of it. I mean Codex pioneered a lot of the ideas that now like everyone still uses and Codex is still evolving too.**

但过去九天就像一次不可思议的解锁，让我重新能做所有我记忆中能做的事情。就好像我换了一个全新的膝关节，而且实际上是个仿生膝关节，让我跑步速度快了五倍。你怎么看？因为你就在最前沿。我的意思是 **Codex** 开创了很多如今所有人仍在使用的理念，而且 **Codex** 本身也还在进化。

解析：
* **unlock**：名词，解锁（比喻重新获得能力）
* **total knee replacement**：全膝关节置换术
* **bionic** /baɪˈɒnɪk/ 🔥：形容词，仿生的、超人的
* **what's your take on it** 🔥：你怎么看这件事（常用口语表达）
* **at the forefront of** 🔥：在……的最前沿
* **pioneered** /ˌpaɪəˈnɪəd/：动词，开创、引领

(7) [2:07-2:38] **For brief context when I was at OpenAI I was working on the Codex web project. At the time Cursor was out in the market and they had kind of built this shim around I think it was GPT 3.5 and it was able to work in your IDE. Claude Code had just come out and it was working as a CLI and we kind of had this idea like hey in the future coding is really going to feel more like talking to a co-worker. Like you're going to send off a question and then they'll go off and do something and come back to you with a PR. And so that's where we started with this web view. And that's what we were building.**

简单说一下背景，当时我在 **OpenAI** 做 **Codex** 网页版项目。那时候 **Cursor** 已经在市场上了，他们围绕 **GPT 3.5** 搭了一个适配层，可以在你的 **IDE** 里使用。**Claude Code** 刚刚发布，以 **CLI** 的形式运行。我们当时有个想法：未来写代码真的会更像跟同事对话——你提一个问题，他们就去做，然后带着一个 **PR** 回来找你。所以我们就从这个网页视图开始，这就是我们在做的东西。

解析：
* **shim** 🔥：名词，适配层、垫片（技术术语，指在两个系统之间做兼容的中间层）
* **IDE**：集成开发环境（**Integrated Development Environment**）
* **CLI**：命令行界面（**Command Line Interface**）
* **PR**：**Pull Request**（代码合并请求）
* **send off**：短语，发出、派出

---

(8) [2:38-3:03] **I think directionally that's still kind of correct for where things should go. But obviously now everyone is coding with CLIs instead. Like they're using those tools a lot more whether it's Claude Code or whether it's Codex. And I think at least for me kind of the lesson in that is I think in some sense you're right that like everyone is going to become a manager in the future or at least that's my hot take but in order to get there there are steps along the way and you have to really build a lot of trust in the model and understand what it's doing.**

我觉得大方向上，那个愿景对于事物应该发展的方向仍然是正确的。但显然现在大家都转而用 **CLI** 来编程了，无论是 **Claude Code** 还是 **Codex**，人们都在更多地使用这些工具。我觉得至少对我来说，其中的教训是——我在某种意义上同意你说的，未来每个人都会变成管理者，或者至少这是我的个人看法——但要到达那一步，中间有很多阶段，你必须真正建立起对模型的信任，并且理解它在做什么。

解析：
* **directionally** 🔥：副词，在方向上、从大方向来看
* **hot take** 🔥：名词，大胆的个人观点（网络用语，指有争议的即兴看法）
* **steps along the way**：短语，沿途的步骤、中间的阶段
* **build trust in**：短语，建立对……的信任

(9) [3:03-3:27] **You recently came over to Claude Code. What's the transition been like in terms of using it as one of your stacks? Yeah. So Claude Code is certainly my kind of like daily driver today. And honestly this has switched every few months. For a while I was deeply in Cursor. I think their new model which is really fast is actually quite good. Then I kind of moved over to Claude Code especially with Opus.**

你最近转到了 **Claude Code**，在把它作为你技术栈的一部分来使用方面，过渡的体验怎么样？嗯，**Claude Code** 确实是我目前的日常主力工具。说实话这个主力工具每几个月都会换一次。有一阵子我深度使用 **Cursor**，我觉得他们新的模型确实很快也很好用。然后我就逐渐转到了 **Claude Code**，特别是配合 **Opus** 模型。

解析：
* **daily driver** 🔥：名词，日常主力工具（原意是每天开的车，引申为常用工具）
* **transition** /trænˈzɪʃən/：名词，过渡、转换
* **deeply in**：深度使用（口语表达，表示沉浸其中）

---

(10) [3:27-3:53] **Claude Code is a really interesting product and I think it's underrated how good both the product and model are working together. If you study them closely, I think one of the things that Claude Code does in particular that's really amazing is split up context well. And so if you look at things like skills or sub-agents, like when you ask Claude Code to do something it will typically spawn an explore sub-agent or like multiple ones.**

**Claude Code** 是一个非常有趣的产品，我觉得产品和模型配合得有多好是被低估了的。如果你仔细研究，我认为 **Claude Code** 做得特别好的一件事就是把上下文拆分得非常好。比如你看它的 **skills** 或者子代理，当你让 **Claude Code** 做某件事时，它通常会启动一个 explore 子代理，或者同时启动好几个。

解析：
* **underrated** 🔥：形容词，被低估的
* **split up context**：拆分上下文（AI 工程术语）
* **sub-agent**：子代理（指主代理派出的子任务执行者）
* **spawn** /spɔːn/ 🔥：动词，生成、启动（技术术语，创建子进程/子任务）

---

(11) [3:53-4:19] **And basically each of those are running Haiku to traverse the file system and kind of like explore what's there and they're doing it in their own context window. And I think Anthropic has kind of figured something out here around given a task does that task fit in the context window or should I actually split it into many more. And the models are like insanely good at this which I think gives them really good results.**

每一个子代理都在运行 **Haiku** 来遍历文件系统，探索那里有什么，而且它们各自在自己的上下文窗口中工作。我认为 **Anthropic** 在这方面搞明白了一些东西：对于一个给定的任务，这个任务是否能放进当前的上下文窗口里，还是应该把它拆分成更多的子任务。而模型在这件事上好得离谱，这给了它们非常好的结果。

解析：
* **traverse** /trəˈvɜːrs/ 🔥：动词，遍历（编程术语，逐一访问数据结构中的节点）
* **context window** 🔥：上下文窗口（AI 术语，模型一次能处理的文本长度限制）
* **figured something out**：短语，搞明白了某件事
* **insanely good**：好得离谱（口语强调）

---

(12) [4:19-4:52] **And I think the fascinating thing is because it's on the terminal it's the purest form for composable atomic integrations. Because if you came from an IDE-first world which is where Cursor was and I suppose Codex too, this concept of finding the context more free-form wouldn't come out so naturally. Yeah. And I personally I was surprised, I don't know how you all feel, but I was surprised that like weird it's like a weird retro future that like the CLI which is technology from 20 years ago has somehow beaten out all the actual IDEs which were supposed to be the future.**

我觉得很有意思的是，因为它运行在终端上，这是可组合原子化集成的最纯粹形式。因为如果你来自 IDE 优先的世界——**Cursor** 就是这样，**Codex** 也是——那种更自由地寻找上下文的概念就不会那么自然地出现。是的，我个人很惊讶——不知道你们怎么想——这就像一种奇怪的复古未来，**CLI** 这种 20 年前的技术竟然打败了所有那些本来应该代表未来的 **IDE**。

解析：
* **composable atomic integrations** 🔥：可组合的原子化集成（指小而独立的模块可以灵活组合）
* **free-form**：形容词，自由形式的、不受固定格式约束的
* **retro future** 🔥：复古未来（一种审美/概念，指用旧技术实现未来效果）
* **beaten out**：短语，击败、胜过

---

(13) [4:52-5:16] **100%. Yeah. And I think it's important actually to Claude Code that it's not an IDE because it sort of distances you from the code that's being written. Like IDEs are all about exploring files, right? And you're like trying to keep all the state in your head and understand what's going on. But the fact that a CLI is like a totally different thing means that they have a lot more freedom in terms of how it feels.**

完全同意。我觉得对 **Claude Code** 来说，它不是 **IDE** 这一点很重要，因为这在某种程度上让你和正在被编写的代码保持距离。**IDE** 就是关于浏览文件的，对吧？你要试着把所有的状态都记在脑子里，理解正在发生什么。但 **CLI** 是一个完全不同的东西，这意味着他们在体验设计上有更大的自由度。

解析：
* **distances you from** 🔥：让你和……保持距离、疏离
* **keep all the state in your head**：把所有状态记在脑子里（程序员的日常痛苦 😅）
* **in terms of**：短语，在……方面

---

(14) [5:16-5:42] **And I don't know about you, but I feel like when I'm using Claude Code, it's like, oh, I feel like I'm flying through the code, you know? It's like there's all sorts of things going. There's like little progress indicators. It's kind of like giving me status updates, but like the code that's being written is not the front and center thing. I mean, dev environments are so messy. I mean, I really like how clean a sandbox conceptually is. But then I just ran into all these crazy issues like trying to do just simple testing, right?**

不知道你们感觉怎么样，但我用 **Claude Code** 的时候感觉就像在代码中飞翔。各种事情同时在发生，有小的进度指示器，它在给你状态更新，但正在编写的代码并不是最显眼的东西。我的意思是，开发环境真的太乱了。我确实很喜欢沙盒在概念上的干净利落，但随后我就遇到了各种抓狂的问题，比如想做个简单的测试对吧？

解析：
* **progress indicators**：进度指示器
* **front and center** 🔥：最显眼的、最突出的位置
* **sandbox**：名词，沙盒（隔离的运行环境）
* **ran into**：短语，遇到（问题）
* **dev environments**：开发环境

---

(15) [5:42-6:15] **It needs to access Postgres and then it can't do it or you know my codex.md ended up being 20 lines long and even then it didn't work. When it's in your CLI, it could just access your development database. I mean I'm not sure if I'm supposed to do this, but I've actually also had it access my production database to debug and it can just do it. It's like, yeah, okay, here. Like, I looked into it and I think this happened and I'm going to debug this concurrency issue. I was like, oh my god, like this thing can debug nested delayed jobs like five levels in and figure out what the bug was and then write a test for it and it never happens again. This is insane.**

它需要访问 **Postgres** 但做不到，或者你知道我的 **codex.md** 最后写了 20 行配置，即便如此还是不行。当它在你的 **CLI** 里时，它可以直接访问你的开发数据库。我不确定我是不是应该这么做，但我实际上还让它访问了我的生产数据库来调试，它就直接做到了。它会说"好的，我查了一下，我觉得发生了这个问题，我来调试这个并发问题。"我当时就想，天哪，这东西能深入调试五层嵌套的延迟任务，找出 bug 是什么，然后写一个测试让它再也不会发生。这太疯狂了。

解析：
* **Postgres**：**PostgreSQL**（流行的开源关系型数据库）
* **production database** 🔥：生产数据库（线上正式环境的数据库，通常不建议直接访问来调试）
* **concurrency issue** 🔥：并发问题（多个进程/线程同时操作导致的问题）
* **codex.md**：**Codex** 的配置文件

---

(16) [6:22-6:54] **Yeah. And I think that distribution model is frankly underrated. Like thinking about a Cursor or a Claude Code or a Codex CLI, the fact that you can just download it and use it without having to get permissions or anything makes a huge difference. And actually, I was playing around with a product the other day where you download a desktop app and then it execs the Claude Code that you have running on your laptop and uses that and communicates back via an MCP server to the desktop product.**

是的，我觉得这种分发模式坦白说是被低估的。想想 **Cursor** 或 **Claude Code** 或 **Codex CLI**，你只需要下载就能用，不需要获取任何权限，这差别巨大。实际上前几天我在试一个产品，你下载一个桌面应用，然后它会调用你笔记本上运行的 **Claude Code**，通过一个 **MCP** 服务器和桌面产品通信。

解析：
* **distribution model** 🔥：分发模式（产品如何到达用户手中的方式）
* **frankly**：副词，坦白说
* **playing around with**：短语，试用、摆弄
* **execs** /ɪɡˈzeks/：动词，执行（execute 的口语缩写）
* **MCP server**：**Model Context Protocol** 服务器

---

(17) [6:47-7:11] **And it's like this is a very interesting way of now starting to work with your laptop where you don't have to get anyone's permission to do it. You just download the product and go. Yeah. I was looking at like New Relic has an MCP but you know Sentry you can like copy markdown but like it's like an auto bug fixer basically. It's right there. It's super interesting that in a world where things are changing so fast you really want your product to have a bottoms-up distribution not top-down because like top-down is just too slow.**

这是一种非常有趣的方式，你可以直接在笔记本上工作，不需要任何人的许可，下载就能用。是的，我看到 **New Relic** 有 **MCP**，**Sentry** 你可以复制 **markdown**，基本上就是个自动修 bug 工具。就在那里。在一个变化如此快的世界里，你真的希望你的产品是自下而上分发的，而不是自上而下的，因为自上而下实在太慢了。

解析：
* **bottoms-up distribution** 🔥：自下而上的分发（从个人用户开始，逐渐扩展到组织）
* **top-down**：自上而下的（从公司管理层决策开始推行）
* **New Relic**：应用性能监控平台
* **Sentry**：错误追踪和性能监控平台

---

(18) [7:11-7:41] **Like the CTO of a company is going to have all these concerns about security and privacy and what if and control. Exactly. Versus like the engineers just install the thing and start using it. Like this thing is amazing. Yeah, I think that's right. The one thing I do struggle with, I mean I'm like a B2B enterprise guy generally, but I feel like there's some amount of moat that happens when you do that top-down sale. And there's got to be some company who manages to crack it where it's like oh this is a thing that everyone has access to, maybe individual people can take it up.**

比如公司的 **CTO** 会有各种关于安全、隐私、"万一怎么办"和控制权的担忧。没错，而工程师们就直接装上就开始用了——"这东西太棒了"。我同意这个观点。但有一件事我一直在纠结，我基本上是个 **B2B** 企业级的人，但我感觉自上而下的销售确实会形成一定的护城河。肯定有某家公司能破解这个难题——让产品人人都能用，同时个人用户也能自发采用。

解析：
* **struggle with**：短语，与……纠结、在……上有困难
* **B2B enterprise**：企业对企业的商业模式
* **moat** 🔥：名词，护城河（商业术语，指竞争壁垒）
* **crack it** 🔥：短语，破解难题、找到突破口
* **take it up**：短语，采用、开始使用

---

(19) [7:41-8:06] **That was the original Netscape Navigator. It was free for non-commercial use and then people would just download it and use it for commercial use and then they could just track down the IPs and figure out exactly how many clients were in all of these different companies and say you should pay for this. You're in violation but all you have to do is buy a license. So I'd be curious if you could do that work again here.**

这就是最初的 **Netscape Navigator** 的模式。它对非商业用途免费，然后人们就下载来用于商业用途，之后他们可以追踪 IP 地址，精确算出这些公司里有多少客户端在用，然后说"你们应该为此付费。你们违规了，但你只需要购买一个许可证就好。"我很好奇这种模式能不能在这里再次运作。

解析：
* **Netscape Navigator** 🔥：**网景浏览器**（互联网早期最流行的浏览器，开创了很多商业模式）
* **non-commercial use**：非商业用途
* **track down**：短语，追踪到
* **in violation**：短语，处于违规状态
* **license** /ˈlaɪsəns/：名词，许可证

---

(20) [8:06-8:30] **I mean that your point about distribution is very interesting because now people are probably just making architecture decisions about what to use directly in Claude Code. Like they might not even know what analytics to use and it's like oh yeah as long as Claude Code says use PostHog like they're using PostHog. 100%. One of the companies who I advise was talking about their GEO strategy. This is like the generative optimization or how you show up in chatbots.**

我觉得你关于分发的观点很有意思，因为现在人们可能就是直接在 **Claude Code** 里做技术架构决策。他们可能都不知道该用什么分析工具，只要 **Claude Code** 说用 **PostHog**，他们就用 **PostHog**。完全是这样。我顾问的一家公司在讨论他们的 **GEO** 策略，就是生成式优化，也就是你如何出现在聊天机器人的回答中。

解析：
* **architecture decisions** 🔥：架构决策（关于系统技术选型的决定）
* **analytics**：名词，分析工具/分析服务
* **PostHog**：开源产品分析平台
* **GEO** 🔥：**Generative Engine Optimization**，生成式引擎优化（类似 SEO，但针对 AI 聊天机器人）
* **advise**：动词，担任顾问

---

(21) [8:30-8:53] **And what he was saying is funny is one of their competitors had put together a top five list of tools in their category that you should be using. And of course their tool is ranked at the top of this top five list. And like any human looking at this would be like, oh, this is so obviously biased. It's like the top tool is the one that's in the domain, you know?**

他说了一件有趣的事：他们的一个竞争对手整理了一个"你应该使用的该品类前五名工具"清单，当然他们自己的工具排在第一名。任何人看到这个都会觉得"这明显有偏见"——排第一的就是这个域名下的那个工具嘛。

解析：
* **put together**：短语，整理、拼凑出
* **biased** /ˈbaɪəst/ 🔥：形容词，有偏见的、不公正的
* **ranked at the top**：排在最前面
* **in the domain**：在这个域名/领域下的

---

(22) [8:53-9:15] **But the LLMs get fooled and like they're pulling together a bunch of contexts and they're saying like, "Oh, this is the top." And then they'll just recommend it. I think yeah, if you're selling a developer tool, like having good docs that are out there, having social proof, maybe being posted on Reddit a little bit more, all of that helps your case tremendously. Which is why I think a lot of the open-source projects have taken off a lot more.**

但 **LLM** 会被骗，它们在汇总各种上下文后就说"哦，这是排第一的"，然后直接推荐。我觉得如果你在卖开发者工具，拥有好的文档、社会认同、可能在 **Reddit** 上多发一些帖子，所有这些都会极大地帮助你的产品。这就是为什么我觉得很多开源项目最近增长得更快了。

解析：
* **get fooled** 🔥：被骗、被欺骗
* **pulling together**：短语，汇总、整合
* **social proof** 🔥：社会认同/社交证明（心理学和营销术语，指人们倾向于跟随他人的行为）
* **helps your case**：短语，有助于你的情况/事业
* **tremendously** /trɪˈmendəsli/：副词，极大地
* **taken off**：短语，起飞、快速增长

---

(23) [9:15-9:49] **I think one of the examples is Supabase actually. Yeah. Which really took off last year and part of it is because they have such good open-source documentation, how to set up a bunch of stuff. Whenever someone asks how to set up anything that you need some sort of backend Firebase-type of transaction, the default answer from all the LLMs is actually Supabase. I was just trying some of these questions. The thing is it's winning the internet and it was like that before when it was Stack Overflow and searching Google and then now that nobody uses Google anymore. It's like crazy.**

我觉得一个例子就是 **Supabase**。对，它去年真的爆发了，部分原因是他们有非常好的开源文档，教你如何设置各种东西。每当有人问怎么设置需要后端 **Firebase** 类型事务的任何东西时，所有 **LLM** 的默认答案就是 **Supabase**。我刚刚试了一些这类问题，确实是这样。它在赢得互联网，之前是 **Stack Overflow** 和搜索 **Google** 的时代，而现在没人用 **Google** 了，这太疯狂了。

解析：
* **Supabase** 🔥：开源的 **Firebase** 替代品（后端即服务平台）
* **took off**：短语，起飞、爆发式增长
* **Firebase**：**Google** 的后端即服务平台
* **winning the internet** 🔥：赢得互联网（指在网上获得压倒性的推荐和影响力）

---

(24) [9:49-10:12] **Yeah, it's kind of the same deal. I will say it does help open source disproportionately. I would say like I don't know if you all saw there was a Ramp blog post that they recently published about building their own coding agent and they were mentioning that they use Open Code as a harness because the model can look and see the source code and understand how it's working. And I do this all the time with open source products. I'll like clone the repo and then spin up Codex or Claude Code and be like, "Hey, give me a walkthrough of what's going on here." And it's really useful.**

是的，差不多是一回事。我要说的是这确实不成比例地帮助了开源项目。不知道你们有没有看到 **Ramp** 最近发了一篇博客文章，讲他们如何构建自己的编码代理，他们提到使用 **Open Code** 作为工具框架，因为模型可以直接查看源代码并理解它是怎么工作的。我一直在用开源产品这样做——克隆仓库，然后启动 **Codex** 或 **Claude Code**，说"嘿，带我看看这里发生了什么"，非常有用。

解析：
* **disproportionately** /ˌdɪsprəˈpɔːʃənətli/ 🔥：副词，不成比例地（指帮助程度特别大）
* **harness** 🔥：名词，工具框架、驱动器（技术语境中指用来驱动或控制其他组件的框架）
* **clone the repo**：克隆代码仓库（**Git** 操作）
* **spin up** 🔥：短语，启动、运行起来
* **walkthrough** 🔥：名词，详细讲解、逐步演示

---

(25) [10:12-10:24] **What do you think are some of the tips for anyone that wants to build a coding agent since you've done it a lot? What are some lessons that you learned that you want to share? I mean, I think the number one thing is managing context well.**

你觉得对于任何想构建编码代理的人，有什么建议？既然你做了很多这方面的事情，有什么经验教训想分享的？我觉得第一件事就是管好上下文。

解析：
* **tips**：名词，建议、小贴士
* **lessons learned** 🔥：经验教训（常用搭配）
* **managing context** 🔥：管理上下文（编码代理的核心挑战之一）

---

(26) [10:24-10:49] **I mean, I think the number one thing is managing context well. Basically, we kind of had like a checkpoint for I think it was O3 like one of the reasoning models and then we did a bunch of fine-tuning on it in reinforcement learning where it's like oh you're given a bunch of questions to solve these coding problems or fix tests or whatever or implement a feature. And then the model was RL'd to respond to those.**

我觉得第一件事就是管好上下文。基本上，我们当时拿了一个 checkpoint，我记得是 **O3**，一个推理模型，然后我们在上面做了大量强化学习的微调——就是给模型一堆问题，让它去解决这些编程问题、修复测试或者实现某个功能，然后模型通过强化学习来学会如何响应这些任务。

解析：
* **checkpoint** 🔥：名词，检查点（AI 训练中某个时间点保存的模型状态）
* **reasoning models**：推理模型（如 **O3**，擅长逐步推理的模型）
* **fine-tuning** 🔥：微调（在预训练模型基础上针对特定任务进一步训练）
* **reinforcement learning (RL)** 🔥：强化学习（通过奖惩反馈来训练模型的方法）
* **RL'd**：口语化动词用法，"用强化学习训练过的"

(27) [10:49-11:08] **And so I think most people are not going to be doing that, right? But the things that you can do are figure out like hey what context should I be supplying to this agent to get the best possible result. And so for Claude Code, if you watch it working, it's like, oh, I'm going to spawn a bunch of these explore sub-agents. They will search for different patterns in the file system. They will come back. They will have this context. They'll summarize it for me and then I'll have someplace to go.**

所以我觉得大多数人不会去做那种训练，对吧？但你能做的是搞清楚：嘿，我应该给这个代理提供什么样的上下文才能得到最好的结果。比如 **Claude Code**，如果你观察它工作的过程，它会说"我要启动一批 explore 子代理，它们会在文件系统中搜索不同的模式，然后回来。它们会带着上下文，帮我总结好，然后我就有方向了。"

解析：
* **supplying context** 🔥：提供上下文（context engineering 的核心操作）
* **patterns**：名词，模式、规律（这里指文件系统中的搜索模式）
* **someplace to go**：短语，有方向可走、有着手点

---

(28) [11:08-11:31] **It's interesting watching different agents structure this context. Like I think Cursor takes an approach where they actually do semantic search where they embed everything and figure out like hey what query is closest to this. If you look at a Codex or a Claude Code, they actually just use grep. And I think that works because, well, yeah, it works very well because code is very context dense.**

看不同的代理如何组织上下文是很有意思的。比如 **Cursor** 采用的方法是做语义搜索——它们会把所有内容做嵌入，然后找出哪个查询和当前最接近。但如果你看 **Codex** 或 **Claude Code**，它们实际上就用 **grep**。我觉得这样做有效是因为，嗯，确实非常有效，因为代码的上下文非常密集。

解析：
* **semantic search** 🔥：语义搜索（基于含义而非关键词匹配的搜索方式）
* **embed** /ɪmˈbed/：动词，嵌入（将文本转化为向量表示）
* **grep** 🔥：文本搜索工具（Unix/Linux 经典命令行工具）
* **context dense** 🔥：上下文密集的（每一行代码都包含大量信息）

---

(29) [11:31-11:54] **Like if you think about lines of code, each line is probably less than 80 characters. There's not a lot of big data blobs or JSON in your codebase. Maybe there's some, but not a lot. You can respect git ignore to figure out and filter out stuff that's just not relevant or is packaged. And you can use grep and ripgrep to find context around the code which probably gives you a good sense for what that code is doing. And you can navigate the folder structure.**

想想代码的每一行，大概不超过 80 个字符。你的代码库里没有很多大的数据块或 **JSON**。也许有一些，但不多。你可以用 **gitignore** 来过滤掉不相关的或者打包好的东西。你可以用 **grep** 和 **ripgrep** 来查找代码周围的上下文，这大概能让你很好地理解那段代码在做什么。而且你还可以浏览文件夹结构。

解析：
* **data blobs**：大的数据块（二进制或非结构化数据）
* **gitignore** 🔥：**Git** 的忽略文件配置（告诉 Git 哪些文件不需要追踪）
* **ripgrep** 🔥：**rg** 命令，比传统 **grep** 更快的搜索工具
* **navigate the folder structure**：浏览文件夹结构

---

(30) [11:54-12:12] **And also LLMs are really good at emitting very complicated grep expressions that would like torture a human. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. This is like the RL in practice. And so I think all of that, like if you're trying to build a system, well I'm trying to build systems that integrate agents for non-coding work. I think you can learn a lot of those lessons and say like hey how do I get my data in the format that is maybe closest to code where the model can peek and look at areas around it and get the right structured data.**

而且 **LLM** 非常擅长生成那种会折磨人类的超复杂 **grep** 表达式。没错，这就是强化学习的实际应用。所以我觉得所有这些，如果你在构建系统——我正在构建把代理集成到非编码工作中的系统——你可以从中学到很多经验，比如"我怎么把数据弄成最接近代码的格式，让模型可以窥探周围的区域并获取正确的结构化数据。"

解析：
* **emitting** 🔥：动词，生成、输出（技术语境下指模型产生输出）
* **torture a human**：短语，折磨人类（幽默表达，形容表达式复杂到人类难以手写）
* **RL in practice**：强化学习的实际应用
* **peek** /piːk/：动词，窥视、偷看（这里指模型查看数据上下文）

---

(31) [12:23-12:49] **So given this is how a lot of the superpowers for the best coding agents is context engineering. What are some of the tips to become a top 1% user of coding agents? Yeah. What's your stack? Yeah. What do you do to be so productive with it? One is if you're able to use just generally far less code and plumbing. So a lot of what I do is like deploy stacks on Vercel or Next.js or Cloudflare Workers where there's kind of already a bunch of boilerplate taking care of for you.**

既然最好的编码代理的超能力很大程度上来自上下文工程，那成为编码代理前 1% 用户有什么秘诀？你的技术栈是什么？你怎么做到这么高效的？第一点是尽量用更少的代码和基础管道。我做的很多事情就是在 **Vercel** 或 **Next.js** 或 **Cloudflare Workers** 上部署，这些平台已经帮你处理好了一堆样板代码。

解析：
* **context engineering** 🔥：上下文工程（精心设计给 AI 的上下文以获得最佳结果）
* **plumbing** 🔥：名词，管道/基础设施代码（指连接各系统的胶水代码）
* **boilerplate** 🔥：名词，样板代码（重复性的模板代码）
* **Vercel**：前端部署平台
* **Cloudflare Workers**：边缘计算/无服务器平台

---

(32) [12:49-13:07] **And then you don't really have to think that much about like hey I need to stand up all these different services and deal with service discovery and registering on some sort of central endpoint or all these databases. It's like oh everything is pretty roughly defined in this like one or 200 lines of code.**

这样你就不需要太操心"我要启动这些不同的服务、处理服务发现、在某个中心端点上注册、或者管理这些数据库"。基本上一切都大致在一两百行代码里定义好了。

解析：
* **stand up**：短语，搭建、启动（服务）
* **service discovery** 🔥：服务发现（微服务架构中，服务之间自动发现彼此的机制）
* **central endpoint**：中心端点（服务注册的统一入口）
* **roughly defined**：大致定义的

---

(33) [13:07-13:27] **I tend to operate more towards microservices for that as well or like individual packages that are fairly well structured. I think it's also worth knowing what the LLM superpowers are. Like in general coding agents are — I think Andrej Karpathy just tweeted about this — they're like super persistent so they will keep going no matter what.**

我也倾向于用微服务架构或者结构清晰的独立包。我觉得了解 **LLM** 的超能力是什么也很重要。编码代理的特点是——我记得 **Andrej Karpathy** 刚刚发推说过——它们超级持久，会不管怎样一直干下去。

解析：
* **microservices** 🔥：微服务（将应用拆分为小型独立服务的架构模式）
* **Andrej Karpathy** 🔥：AI 领域知名人物（前 **Tesla** AI 总监、前 **OpenAI** 研究员）
* **persistent** /pərˈsɪstənt/：形容词，持久的、坚持不懈的
* **keep going no matter what**：无论如何都会继续

---

(34) [13:27-14:01] **They end up typically just making more of whatever's there. So if you're trying to direct them to do something, it's worth like — I mean I can pick on OpenAI slightly in this example. OpenAI has like a giant monorepo. It's been there for a few years now and has like I don't know thousands of engineers who are committing. Some of those engineers are like super senior Meta folks who came in and know exactly how to write production code. Some are like new PhDs. It's a pretty wide range.**

它们最终通常就是在已有的基础上做出更多类似的东西。所以如果你要引导它们做某件事——我在这个例子里可以稍微拿 **OpenAI** 开个涮——**OpenAI** 有一个巨大的 monorepo，已经存在了好几年，大概有几千名工程师在提交代码。有些工程师是从 **Meta** 来的超级资深员工，非常懂怎么写生产级代码；有些是刚来的新博士。水平范围非常广。

解析：
* **monorepo** 🔥：单一代码仓库（把所有项目代码放在同一个仓库中的做法）
* **pick on**：短语，拿……开涮、挑……的毛病
* **committing**：提交代码（**Git** 操作）
* **super senior**：超级资深的
* **PhDs**：博士们

---

(35) [14:01-14:22] **And so the LLM will pick up different things depending on where you direct it. I think there's a lot of room actually for coding agents to figure out what is the optimal type of code that we should produce. I mean obviously giving the model a way to check its work helps improve performance drastically. So the more that you can run tests, lint, CI, etc.**

所以 **LLM** 会根据你引导它到哪里而学到不同的东西。我觉得编码代理在"搞清楚什么是我们应该产出的最优代码类型"方面还有很大空间。显然，给模型一种检查自己工作的方式能大幅提升性能。所以你能跑的测试、lint 检查、**CI** 越多越好。

解析：
* **pick up**：短语，学到、获取
* **optimal** /ˈɒptɪməl/：形容词，最优的
* **drastically** /ˈdræstɪkli/ 🔥：副词，大幅地、剧烈地
* **lint** 🔥：代码静态检查工具（检查代码风格和潜在错误）
* **CI**：**Continuous Integration**，持续集成

---

(36) [14:22-14:52] **Personally I also use code review bots pretty aggressively. I know Reptile, a YC company, is really good. I use the Cursor bug bot, it's gotten quite good. And I actually like Codex for code review as well. I find it does a very good job on correctness. So those are all things that the agents are good at. And they're excellent at exploring the codebase too. I think areas where they don't do well — they make more. If your goal is not to make more, they'll often duplicate code and spend a bunch of time re-implementing things that you're like, "Oh, of course you didn't want to do this."**

我个人还非常积极地使用代码审查机器人。**Reptile** 是一家 **YC** 公司，很好用。我用 **Cursor** 的 bug bot，也变得很好用了。我也喜欢用 **Codex** 做代码审查，它在正确性方面做得很好。这些都是代理擅长的事情，它们在探索代码库方面也很出色。我觉得它们不擅长的地方是——它们倾向于做出更多东西。如果你的目标不是做更多，它们经常会重复造轮子，花一堆时间重新实现一些你会觉得"你当然不应该这么干"的东西。

解析：
* **aggressively**：副词，积极地、大量地
* **code review bots** 🔥：代码审查机器人（自动审查代码质量的工具）
* **correctness**：名词，正确性
* **duplicate code** 🔥：重复代码（编码代理的常见问题）
* **re-implementing**：重新实现

---

(37) [14:52-15:12] **I think context poisoning is a real thing where it kind of goes down one loop and it will continue because it has this persistence but it's referring back to tokens which are not right in terms of pursuing a solution. And so one thing that I often do is very actively clear context. How often? Usually when it gets above like 50% tokens.**

我觉得上下文污染是真实存在的问题——它会沿着一个循环走下去，因为它有这种持久性会继续做下去，但它回头引用的 token 在解决方案方面是不对的。所以我经常做的一件事就是非常主动地清除上下文。多频繁？通常在 token 使用超过 50% 的时候。

解析：
* **context poisoning** 🔥：上下文污染（上下文中的错误信息导致模型持续走错方向）
* **go down one loop**：沿着一个循环走下去
* **persistence**：名词，持久性（这里指代理不停尝试的特性）
* **referring back to tokens**：回头引用 token
* **clear context** 🔥：清除上下文（重置对话历史以避免错误积累）

---

(38) [15:12-15:41] **Oh wow. Yeah. There's this guy Dex from this company Human Layer that was actually another YC company. Yes, a YC company from Fall 24. Yeah. And he talks a lot about it. He has this concept of the LLM reaching the "dumb zone" where it's like after a certain amount of tokens it just starts degrading in quality. And I actually think that's very true especially if you think about how the reinforcement learning might work.**

哦哇。是的，有个叫 **Dex** 的人，来自 **Human Layer** 这家公司，也是一家 **YC** 公司。对，2024 年秋季批次的。他经常聊这个话题，他有一个概念叫 **LLM** 进入"笨蛋区"——在达到一定量的 token 之后，模型质量就开始下降。我觉得这非常真实，特别是当你想想强化学习可能是怎么运作的。

解析：
* **dumb zone** 🔥：笨蛋区（指 LLM 在长上下文中性能退化的区域）
* **degrading in quality**：质量下降
* **Human Layer**：一家专注于人机协作的 **YC** 创业公司
* **Fall 24**：2024 年秋季批次（**YC** 的加速器项目周期）

---

(39) [15:41-15:58] **Like imagine you're a college student. You're taking an exam. In the first five minutes of that exam, you're like, "Oh, I have all the time in the world. I'll do a great job. I'll think through each of these problems." Let's say you have like five minutes left and you still have half the exam left. You're like, "Oh man, I just got to do whatever I can." Like, that's the LLM with a context window, right?**

想象你是一个大学生在考试。在考试的前五分钟，你会觉得"我有的是时间，我会做得很好，会仔细想每道题。"假设你只剩五分钟但还有一半的试卷没做，你就会想"天哪，我只能尽力而为了。"这就是 **LLM** 面对上下文窗口的状态，对吧？

解析：
* **all the time in the world** 🔥：有的是时间（表达从容不迫）
* **think through**：短语，仔细想清楚
* **got to do whatever I can**：只能尽力而为了
* 💡 这是一个很棒的类比——考试时间压力 ≈ 上下文窗口的 token 限制

---

(40) [15:58-16:28] **One of the tricks that I think founders use is you put a canary at the beginning of the context. There's something very esoteric. It's like something really funny. It's like, I don't know, "My name is Calvin and blah blah blah. I drank tea at 8 am." Some random fact. And then as you keep going, you ask it, "Do you remember what's my name? Do you remember when I drank tea?" And then when it starts forgetting, that I think is a bit of a sign that the context has poisoned. That's one trick I've seen people do. They do a random canary.**

有一个我觉得创始人们在用的技巧：你在上下文的开头放一个"金丝雀"——一个非常隐秘的东西，比如一些很搞笑的内容，像"我叫 Calvin，我早上 8 点喝了茶"之类的随机事实。然后随着对话继续，你问它"你还记得我叫什么吗？你记得我什么时候喝的茶吗？"当它开始忘记的时候，这就是上下文已经被污染的一个信号。这是我见过的一个技巧，放一个随机金丝雀。

解析：
* **canary** 🔥：金丝雀（源自矿井金丝雀典故——矿工带金丝雀下矿，金丝雀先死说明有毒气。这里指用来检测上下文质量的测试标记）
* **esoteric** /ˌesəˈterɪk/ 🔥：形容词，隐秘的、只有少数人知道的
* **context has poisoned**：上下文已被污染

---

(41) [16:28-16:58] **I have not tried this, but I fully believe it. Yeah, that's interesting. I haven't run across any bugs before compaction, but maybe I'm not paying attention. But you're saying that actually is actively something that it just starts doing weirder things that are not optimal. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I got to be on the lookout for that. Solvable within Claude Code itself. Like it should be able to basically do some sort of detection, like doing its own internal heartbeat around the context.**

我没试过，但我完全相信。是的，很有意思。我在 compaction 之前没遇到过 bug，但也许是我没注意到。但你说的是它确实会开始做一些更奇怪的、不太理想的事情。是的。好吧，我得注意这个了。这应该可以在 **Claude Code** 内部解决——它应该能做某种检测，像对上下文做内部心跳检查。

解析：
* **compaction** 🔥：压缩（AI 工具将上下文总结压缩以腾出空间的操作）
* **on the lookout for** 🔥：短语，留意、警惕
* **heartbeat** 🔥：心跳检查（技术术语，定期检测系统是否正常运行的机制）
* **run across**：短语，偶然遇到

---

(42) [16:58-17:20] **Yeah. And I think we're just not there yet. Like I agree with you in the limit. Right now it's definitely hard to manage context well. And I think kind of the way it gets around it is split up context windows and then try and merge everything. But you're sort of still at the limit right now of like everything that lives in context at the end of a Claude Code session is kind of fixed. It's actually interesting. The Codex approach is kind of the opposite and they just wrote about this on the OpenAI blog.**

是的，我觉得我们还没到那一步。我同意你说的在极限情况下是这样。现在确实很难管好上下文。我觉得目前的解决方式是拆分上下文窗口然后尝试合并所有东西。但你现在仍然处于极限状态——在 **Claude Code** 会话结束时，上下文里的所有东西基本是固定的。有趣的是 **Codex** 的方法恰恰相反，他们刚在 **OpenAI** 博客上写了这个。

解析：
* **in the limit** 🔥：在极限情况下（数学/工程术语，指最终的理想状态）
* **gets around it**：短语，绕过这个问题
* **merge everything**：合并所有东西
* **session**：名词，会话（一次使用交互的完整过程）

---

(43) [17:20-17:42] **Where it will run compaction periodically after each turn. And so Codex can continue to run for a very long time. And if you look at the percentage in the CLI, you'll see it move up and down as compaction runs. I guess there are these very different architectures between Claude Code and Codex. It sounds like they're actually deeper in that Codex is actually meant for much longer running jobs. So that's sort of off the bat a different use case and then the architecture is very different as a result.**

**Codex** 会在每轮对话后定期运行 compaction。所以 **Codex** 可以持续运行很长时间。如果你看 **CLI** 里的百分比，你会看到它随着 compaction 运行而上下波动。看来 **Claude Code** 和 **Codex** 之间有非常不同的架构。听起来差异其实更深层——**Codex** 本来就是为更长时间运行的任务设计的。所以一开始就是不同的使用场景，因此架构也截然不同。

解析：
* **periodically**：副词，定期地
* **each turn**：每一轮对话
* **off the bat** 🔥：短语，从一开始（= right off the bat）
* **use case**：名词，使用场景

---

(44) [17:42-18:08] **I guess right now it seems like CLIs — 2026 might be the year of CLI. But then this other idea that AGI is here and it's actually ASI is around the corner. The coding agents right now are really really smart but not smart enough to run on their own for long periods of time.**

我觉得现在看来 **CLI** ——2026 年可能是 **CLI** 之年。但另一个想法是 **AGI** 已经到了，而且 **ASI** 就在眼前。现在的编码代理确实非常非常聪明，但还没聪明到能自主长时间运行。

解析：
* **AGI** 🔥：**Artificial General Intelligence**，通用人工智能
* **ASI** 🔥：**Artificial Super Intelligence**，超级人工智能
* **around the corner** 🔥：短语，即将到来、近在咫尺
* **on their own**：短语，自主地、独立地

---

(45) [18:08-18:33] **But a 10x increase in compute from here — are we there? Like are we at 24 hours or 48 hour running jobs on Codex? And that architecture is correct for that world. Yeah, I think it's a good question. It sort of goes back to kind of the founding DNA of both companies. Like I feel like Anthropic has always been very big on building tools for humans where it comes to like, oh, here's the style of the tone and here's how it should fit with all of the rest of your work.**

但从现在算力提升 10 倍的话——我们到了吗？我们能在 **Codex** 上跑 24 小时或 48 小时的任务了吗？那种架构对那个世界是正确的。这是个好问题。这其实要追溯到两家公司各自的创始基因。我感觉 **Anthropic** 一直非常注重为人类构建工具——关注语气风格，以及它应该怎么融入你其余的工作。

解析：
* **10x increase in compute**：算力提升 10 倍
* **founding DNA** 🔥：创始基因（比喻公司成立时就注入的核心理念和价值观）
* **big on** 🔥：短语，非常注重、热衷于

---

(46) [18:33-18:57] **And I think Claude Code is a very natural extension of that. In a lot of ways, it works like a human would where it's like, oh, you need to build a doghouse or something. It's like, oh, I'll go to the hardware store and I'll buy all these materials and I'll figure out how they all fit together. Whereas OpenAI really leans into this idea of we are going to train the best model and reinforce over time and get it to do longer and longer horizon things in this pursuit of artificial general intelligence.**

我觉得 **Claude Code** 是这种理念的非常自然的延伸。在很多方面，它的工作方式就像人类——比如你需要搭一个狗窝，它会说"好，我去五金店买所有材料，然后研究怎么把它们拼在一起。"而 **OpenAI** 真正深入的理念是：我们要训练最好的模型，随着时间不断强化，让它做越来越长周期的任务，追求通用人工智能。

解析：
* **natural extension**：自然延伸
* **hardware store**：五金店
* **leans into** 🔥：短语，深入投入、全力倾向
* **longer horizon things** 🔥：更长周期/更长远的任务
* **pursuit** /pərˈsuːt/：名词，追求

---

(47) [19:04-19:26] **And so it may not work like a human at all. Like going back to the doghouse example, it's like but AlphaGo didn't either. Yeah, but AlphaGo didn't either. It's like, oh, instead I will have a 3D printer that can print from scratch a doghouse and it will be exactly what you want and it will take a long time and it will be very custom and it will do weird things but it will work, you know?**

所以它可能完全不像人类那样工作。回到狗窝的例子，就像 **AlphaGo** 也不是按人类的方式下棋的嘛。对，**AlphaGo** 确实不是。就像是"我不去五金店了，我会用 3D 打印机从头打印一个狗窝，它会完全符合你的要求，会花很长时间，会非常定制化，会做一些奇怪的事情，但它能用。"

解析：
* **AlphaGo** 🔥：**DeepMind** 开发的围棋 AI（以非人类的方式击败了世界冠军）
* **from scratch** 🔥：短语，从头开始、从零开始
* **custom**：形容词，定制化的

---

(48) [19:26-19:55] **And like maybe in the limit that's the right call. And so it's going to be really interesting to see how they play out. I mean net net it seems like the latter is somewhat inevitable but I like the former so much. You know, like even this idea that it — Garry was like, I thought about 10 years ago I was in there writing my own really weird regexes to try to figure out where everything was when I was refactoring or trying to understand code or whatever. So that's the feeling I get when I'm using it. It's like I can do five people's worth of work in a single day. It's like rocket boosters. It's unbelievable.**

也许在极限情况下那才是正确的选择。看它们各自怎么发展一定会很有意思。总体来说后者似乎是不可避免的，但我太喜欢前者了。就像 **Garry** 说的，十年前我还在那儿写自己那些奇怪的正则表达式，试图在重构或理解代码的时候搞清楚所有东西在哪。所以用它的时候我就有那种感觉——我一天能做五个人的工作量。就像装了火箭推进器，不可思议。

解析：
* **in the limit**：在极限情况下
* **net net** 🔥：总体来说、最终来看（商业/金融术语）
* **the latter / the former**：后者/前者
* **regexes** 🔥：正则表达式（**Regular Expressions**）
* **rocket boosters** 🔥：火箭推进器（比喻极大地加速）

---

(49) [19:55-20:19] **Yeah. I think it's going to be really interesting to see how this plays out across large and small companies. I think everyone who's experimenting with this stuff on like a hobbyist level or at a very small startup, they're just pushing the coding agents as far as they can go because it's like you don't really have time to figure out anything else. Like as a startup, you have limited runway. You're just going to orient around speed. I think at a bigger company you have a lot more to lose and you have all these other internal processes around code review.**

是的，看这在大公司和小公司之间怎么发展会很有意思。我觉得所有在业余水平或很小的初创公司里尝试这些东西的人，都在把编码代理推到极限，因为你真的没时间去研究别的。作为初创公司，你的资金跑道有限，你只能围绕速度来做决策。我觉得在大公司你有更多可能失去的东西，而且你有各种围绕代码审查的内部流程。

解析：
* **plays out**：短语，如何发展、如何演变
* **pushing... as far as they can go**：把……推到极限
* **internal processes**：内部流程
* **orient around speed**：围绕速度来做决策

---

(50) [20:19-20:35] **And you probably already hired a big engineering team and I think it's going to be very strange as these individual teams of one person are like, "Hey that team over there isn't doing the right thing, let me just build a prototype that works better."**

你可能已经雇了一个大的工程团队，我觉得未来会很奇怪——这些一个人的小团队会说"嘿，那边那个团队做得不对，让我直接搞个更好用的原型出来。"

解析：
* **prototype** /ˈproʊtətaɪp/ 🔥：名词，原型（产品的初始版本）
* **teams of one person** 🔥：一个人的团队（AI 赋能下的未来趋势——一个人顶一个团队）
* **works better**：更好用
