(1) [0:00-0:21] **Uh, working with Zuck was amazing. He was always brutally honest, like very straightforward. Let me give you a concrete example of where he was just trying to push the boundaries. Today I'm interviewing Philip Su, a former distinguished engineer at Meta, which is one of the highest levels of software engineering across the industry.**

和 **Zuck** 共事真的很棒。他总是非常直接坦诚，就是很直来直去那种。让我给你举个他试图突破边界的具体例子。今天我要采访的是 **Philip Su**，他是 **Meta** 的前杰出工程师，这是整个行业软件工程师的最高级别之一。

解析：
* **brutally honest** 🔥：极度坦诚、直言不讳（brutally 字面意思是"残忍地"，这里强调程度）
* **straightforward**：形容词，直接的、坦率的
* **push the boundaries** 🔥：突破边界、挑战极限
* **distinguished engineer**：杰出工程师（大厂的顶级技术职级）

---

(2) [0:21-0:43] **It's four whole levels above being a senior. He got to work directly with Mark Zuckerberg and Meta CTO's before he decided to leave and join OpenAI in its earliest days. There he got exclusive firsthand experience on the future of AI. And in this video, we're going to be diving into his experience, his insights on AI, and what you as a computer science or software engineering student need to do to navigate this new reality.**

这个职级比 **Senior** 整整高出四级。在离开之前，他曾直接与 **Mark Zuckerberg** 和 **Meta** 的 **CTO** 们共事，后来在 **OpenAI** 最早期的时候加入了那里。在那里他获得了关于 AI 未来的独家一手经验。在这个视频中，我们将深入了解他的经历、他对 AI 的见解，以及作为计算机科学或软件工程学生的你需要做什么来应对这个新现实。

解析：
* **four whole levels above**：整整高出四级（whole 强调完整的四级）
* **firsthand experience** 🔥：一手经验、亲身体验
* **dive into** 🔥：深入探讨（口语常用表达）
* **navigate**：动词，导航、应对（这里指应对挑战）

---

(3) [0:43-1:06] **Are computer science majors cooked? Is AI taking over? I think in the long run, it feels like yes. With that being said, let's get right into the video. You were a distinguished software engineer at Meta, which is one of the highest levels of software engineering at that company and at most companies. Like there are juniors, there are seniors, there are principals and way above that we got distinguished engineer. You were one of eight people who got that honor. Can you tell me how you got there?**

计算机专业的人是不是要完蛋了？AI 是不是要接管一切？我觉得从长远来看，感觉确实是这样。话虽如此，让我们直接进入正题。你曾是 **Meta** 的杰出软件工程师，这是那家公司乃至大多数公司软件工程的最高级别之一。有初级、高级、首席，然后比这些都高的就是杰出工程师。你是获得这个荣誉的八人之一。能告诉我你是怎么做到的吗？

解析：
* **cooked** 🔥：俚语，完蛋了、凉了（网络用语）
* **in the long run** 🔥：从长远来看
* **with that being said** 🔥：话虽如此（转折用语）
* **principal**：首席工程师（职级名称）

(4) [1:06-1:31] **Yeah, great question. So, I had been working in industry by that point probably 20 years and so it had been a long slow journey, right? But I also think I joined Facebook at a relatively early time when there were many opportunities to do big things. And so for instance my first feature video calling was written with just two other engineers and it was the entire feature end to end, right? And so product reviews were done with Zuck directly and things like that.**

好问题。到那时我在业界已经工作了大概 20 年，所以这是一段漫长而缓慢的旅程。但我也认为我在一个相对早期的时间加入了 **Facebook**，那时有很多做大事的机会。比如我的第一个功能——视频通话——只和另外两个工程师一起写的，而且是端到端的完整功能。所以产品评审是直接和 **Zuck** 做的，诸如此类。

解析：
* **by that point**：到那时为止
* **end to end** 🔥：端到端、从头到尾（技术术语，指完整的功能链路）
* **product review**：产品评审

---

(5) [1:31-1:54] **And so I think because of that there were just a lot of opportunities. When I started in industry, for instance, I spent all my time at work, like literally, you know, probably 18 plus hours, right? I had a sleeping bag in my office like I just worked all hours. And that's definitely not something that I recommend unless a person is really committed to that being what they want, right? But I do think like those long hours were a big thing.**

所以我认为正因如此，机会非常多。当我刚入行的时候，比如说，我把所有时间都花在工作上，字面意思上的，大概每天 18 小时以上。我办公室里有个睡袋，就是一直在工作。这绝对不是我推荐的做法，除非一个人真的愿意把这作为自己想要的生活方式。但我确实认为那些长时间的工作是个重要因素。

解析：
* **literally**：副词，字面意思上地（强调真实性）
* **sleeping bag**：睡袋
* **committed to** 🔥：致力于、全身心投入于
* **a big thing**：重要的事情、关键因素

---

(6) [1:54-2:12] **And I think a lot of it also is just being in the right company at the right time, right? You can be doing great work, but if the company is not itself expanding into bigger opportunities, then your own opportunities will be limited by that. Whereas I think when I joined Facebook, it was expanding very quickly and so there were so many domains that you could do interesting work in.**

我认为很大程度上也是在正确的时间在正确的公司。你可以做出很棒的工作，但如果公司本身没有扩展到更大的机会，那你自己的机会也会受限于此。而我加入 **Facebook** 时，它正在快速扩张，所以有很多领域可以做有趣的工作。

解析：
* **the right company at the right time** 🔥：天时地利（在正确的时间在正确的公司）
* **expanding into**：扩展到、拓展到
* **limited by**：受限于
* **domain**：领域、范畴

---

(7) [2:19-2:49] **Were there any key projects or technical artifacts that you developed per se that really pushed you to get to the distinguished level? I think the work that really helped grow me over time, you know, we did a rewrite of web messenger which was really fascinating. Did the video calling feature, worked on workplace a bit and a few other products, worked in the sharing team for newsfeed and stuff like that. So there were just many opportunities. Whereas at Microsoft for instance when I worked there, a person switches teams maybe every two to five years. At Facebook it was very common to switch teams every six months because products were shipping so quickly.**

有没有什么关键项目或技术成果真正推动你达到杰出级别？我认为真正帮助我成长的工作——我们重写了网页版 **Messenger**，非常有意思。做了视频通话功能，在 **Workplace** 上做了一些工作还有其他几个产品，在 **Newsfeed** 的分享团队工作过等等。所以机会非常多。而在 **Microsoft**，我工作过的地方，一个人可能每两到五年才换一次团队。在 **Facebook**，每六个月换团队是很常见的，因为产品发布得太快了。

解析：
* **per se** /pɜːr ˈseɪ/：本身、就其本身而言（拉丁语借词）
* **artifact**：产物、成果（技术语境下指技术产出）
* **rewrite**：重写（代码）
* **shipping** 🔥：发布、上线（软件行业常用）

---

(8) [2:49-3:19] **You probably shipped your product in six months and so you moved on to other things. And at what point did you join Facebook to have all these opportunities? When I joined the company was 500 engineers globally. So you got to put in your imprint early on because it was very small back then. And so with 500 engineers, if you think about the people at maybe senior or principal level, it would be realistic to know all of them, you know? And so the work is very direct. The level of trust between teams is very high because you know the individuals personally.**

你大概六个月就发布了产品，然后就去做其他事情了。你是在什么时候加入 **Facebook** 才有这些机会的？我加入时公司全球只有 500 名工程师。所以你能够早早留下自己的印记，因为那时公司还很小。有 500 名工程师的话，如果你想想那些高级或首席级别的人，认识所有人是完全现实的。所以工作非常直接。团队之间的信任度非常高，因为你个人认识这些人。

解析：
* **put in your imprint** 🔥：留下你的印记（imprint 指印记、烙印）
* **back then**：那时候
* **realistic**：现实的、可行的
* **the level of trust**：信任度

---

(9) [3:26-3:56] **And so I know as junior software engineers and even to a certain level senior software engineers, we write code, we create design documents, sometimes talk to customers. Once you start getting past that, distinguished engineer or even like certain levels around there, what is the nature of your work? Yeah, this is a great question because I think it's different from some jobs. Like for instance, take professional basketball, right? If you start off as a basketball player and you eventually get drafted into the NBA, the skills that got you there are still going to be the skills that will make you great.**

我知道作为初级软件工程师，甚至到一定程度的高级软件工程师，我们写代码、写设计文档、有时和客户交流。一旦你超过那个阶段，成为杰出工程师或者类似级别，你的工作性质是什么？这是个好问题，因为我认为这和一些工作不同。比如职业篮球，对吧？如果你一开始是篮球运动员，最终被选入 **NBA**，那些让你走到那一步的技能仍然会是让你变得出色的技能。

解析：
* **design document**：设计文档
* **the nature of your work**：你工作的本质/性质
* **get drafted into** 🔥：被选入（draft 在体育语境下指选秀）

---

(10) [3:56-4:20] **Like you just have to be great at an exceptional level, right? I don't think that's true for most software developers. Meaning like the things that got you there aren't going to get you to the next level. So when you first start, it's a lot about being able to implement things well and correctly and quickly, right? But eventually everybody gets to an asymptotic point where their personal contribution code-wise can only be so much.**

你只需要在一个超凡的水平上做到卓越就行。我认为对大多数软件开发者来说不是这样。意思是，那些让你走到现在的东西不会让你到达下一个级别。所以当你刚开始时，很大程度上是关于能够把事情实现得好、正确、快速。但最终每个人都会到达一个渐近点，他们在代码层面的个人贡献只能有那么多。

解析：
* **exceptional level**：超凡的水平
* **asymptotic point** /ˌæsɪmˈtɒtɪk/：渐近点（数学术语，指接近但永远达不到的极限）
* **code-wise**：在代码方面（-wise 后缀表示"在...方面"）

---

(11) [4:20-4:50] **A lot of your impact later on will be helping the team choose the right things to work on being a huge thing. Convincing the team about technical vision or even about business vision is going to be a huge thing. So I think those skills are often not the ones that most software developers have when they first start. Interesting. Yeah. So I think especially junior software engineers, we're like code code, right? We're barely thinking about the full scope of the work that we're working on. We might not even own a feature of a product, right?**

你后期的很多影响力将来自于帮助团队选择正确的事情去做，这是件大事。说服团队接受技术愿景甚至商业愿景将是件大事。所以我认为那些技能通常不是大多数软件开发者刚开始时具备的。有意思。是的，我觉得特别是初级软件工程师，我们就是代码代码代码，对吧？我们几乎没有考虑过我们正在做的工作的全貌。我们甚至可能都没有拥有产品的某个功能。

解析：
* **technical vision**：技术愿景
* **business vision**：商业愿景
* **the full scope** 🔥：全貌、完整范围（scope 指范围）
* **own a feature** 🔥：负责/拥有一个功能（软件行业常用表达）

---

(12) [4:50-5:07] **So, how does one start thinking like that? I think a huge thing many people miss is most people don't think like owners, meaning owners of the business, not owners of a feature. Like, you've got to think to yourself always, if I ran this company, would I want myself to be working on this thing right now in this way? Most people don't think that way.**

那一个人怎么开始这样思考呢？我认为很多人忽略的一件大事是——大多数人不像老板那样思考，我指的是企业的老板，不是功能的负责人。你得总是问自己，如果我经营这家公司，我会希望自己现在以这种方式做这件事吗？大多数人不这样想。

解析：
* **think like owners** 🔥：像老板一样思考（owner mindset 的核心概念）
* **run the company**：经营公司

---

(13) [5:07-5:42] **Do you have an example of that? Yeah. Let me give you super concrete things, right? Like, for instance, most people if their workplace lets them fly business class, they'll do all sorts of things to fly business, right? Like people at Microsoft used to do funny things like reroute the flight to have a leg that was long enough to qualify for business so they could get it. If you own the business you wouldn't do that. If it was your money you wouldn't do that, right? So then if you don't act like an owner you'll never be made an owner, right?**

你能举个例子吗？当然。让我给你一些非常具体的例子。比如说，大多数人如果公司允许他们坐商务舱，他们会想尽办法去坐商务舱。像 **Microsoft** 的人以前会做一些有趣的事，比如绕道让航班有一段足够长的航程来符合商务舱的条件。如果你是公司老板，你不会这样做。如果是你自己的钱，你不会这样做，对吧？所以如果你不像老板那样行事，你永远不会被提拔为老板。

解析：
* **concrete**：具体的
* **fly business class**：坐商务舱
* **reroute**：改变路线、绕道
* **qualify for** 🔥：符合...的条件

---

(14) [5:42-6:14] **So I feel like most people don't embrace the larger question of like, should I be working on this? If I own this place, would I spend money this way? Would I spend my time this way? I think the more you can think from an overall holistic perspective and think in a way that's aligned with what all the strategic people in the company would agree with, the easier time you will get in growing. I guess I have a follow-up question on that. Is as a junior engineer, if you even want to think like an owner, right? Sometimes you're given such little scope in terms of where you can make a contribution.**

所以我觉得大多数人没有去思考更大的问题，比如：我应该做这件事吗？如果这地方是我的，我会这样花钱吗？我会这样花时间吗？我认为你越能从整体的、全局的视角思考，越能以一种与公司所有战略层人士一致的方式思考，你就越容易成长。我有个后续问题。作为初级工程师，如果你想像老板那样思考，有时你被给予的影响范围太小了。

解析：
* **embrace** 🔥：接受、拥抱（这里指愿意去思考）
* **holistic perspective** 🔥：整体视角、全局观（holistic 指整体的）
* **aligned with**：与...一致
* **follow-up question**：后续问题

---

(15) [6:14-6:49] **Such that if a senior engineer or principal engineer is like saying something, "this is how it'll be," why would they evaluate your opinions over theirs? So then how would you ever be able to make that? Yeah, that is a really deep and profound question. So I think I will cover it on a few fronts. First is, as you know, most tech companies still claim they cannot hire all the right people they need. Most companies, even despite layoffs, like they will continue to tell you they cannot hire all those people. So, by definition, the team that you're on, most likely if they could get a more experienced person on it, they would love that.**

如果一个高级工程师或首席工程师说"就这样做"，为什么他们会重视你的意见而不是他们自己的？那你怎么可能做到呢？这是一个非常深刻的问题。我会从几个方面来回答。首先，如你所知，大多数科技公司仍然声称他们无法雇到所有需要的合适人才。大多数公司，即使有裁员，仍会继续告诉你他们雇不到那些人。所以从定义上来说，你所在的团队，如果能得到一个更有经验的人，他们很可能会很高兴。

解析：
* **evaluate your opinions over theirs**：重视你的意见而非他们的
* **deep and profound**：深刻的（profound 强调意义深远）
* **cover it on a few fronts**：从几个方面来讲（front 指方面、层面）
* **by definition** 🔥：从定义上来说、本质上

---

(16) [6:49-7:18] **And then the question is, why aren't you that person? Right? If they claim they need it and yet you aren't that person, what's stopping it? I think there are a few things that might be stopping it. One is simply we don't all have the skills we will eventually have one day in our career. So some of it is you've got to earn that respect, right? And earning that respect means like, um, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, like if all you can be is a bush, be the best little bush, right? Like if you cannot be trusted with small things, no one's going to trust you with big things.**

那问题就是，为什么你不是那个人？如果他们声称需要这样的人，而你不是，是什么阻止了你？我认为有几件事可能在阻止你。一是我们并不都具备我们职业生涯中最终会拥有的技能。所以部分原因是你得去赢得那份尊重。赢得尊重意味着——就像马丁·路德·金博士说的——如果你只能做一棵灌木，就做最好的小灌木。如果你不能被信任做小事，没人会信任你做大事。

解析：
* **what's stopping it**：是什么阻止了它
* **earn that respect** 🔥：赢得尊重
* **be trusted with** 🔥：被信任去做某事

---

(17) [7:18-7:48] **And so when you start on a mundane thing, like it's very standard when you first join a team, you probably fix bugs, right? Well, be the best bug fixer there is, right? Fix them faster than anybody else, right? You got to earn that before people give it to you. But the second thing about it is a lot of times we're so heads down that we don't make the time to spend to think about the larger things that would impact the team. So often we're so busy trying to meet our bug fixing criteria. We're like we're going to ship this product, right?**

所以当你从平凡的事情开始——刚加入团队时很常见，你可能要修 bug，对吧？那就做最好的 bug 修复者。比任何人都修得快。你得先赢得这个，人们才会给你更多。但第二点是，很多时候我们太埋头苦干了，没有时间去思考那些会影响团队的更大的事情。我们常常忙于达到 bug 修复指标，想着要发布产品。

解析：
* **mundane** /mʌnˈdeɪn/：平凡的、日常的
* **heads down** 🔥：埋头苦干（指专注于手头工作而忽略其他）
* **bug fixer**：修 bug 的人
* **criteria**：标准、指标（criterion 的复数）

---

(18) [7:48-8:20] **That very few people are taking the time to, for instance, consider what industry competitors might be doing at this moment, what the business might need that might be bigger than the thing. So much of our time is spent trying to microoptimize and be efficient in our day-to-day work. Instead of making the biggest efficiency gain, which is choosing the right things to work on. So I guess start in your small spheres of influence. Do the best that you can. Yes. And then it'll start growing. But still always think kind of like an owner. Yes. As if this is your product that you're shipping out, not Zuckerberg's product or anyone else.**

很少有人花时间去考虑，比如行业竞争对手此刻在做什么，业务可能需要什么比当前任务更重要的东西。我们的大量时间都花在微优化和提高日常工作效率上，而不是做出最大的效率提升——选择正确的事情去做。所以我猜从你小范围的影响力开始，尽你所能做到最好。是的，然后它会开始扩大。但仍然要像老板一样思考，就好像这是你要发布的产品，不是 **Zuckerberg** 或其他任何人的产品。

解析：
* **microoptimize**：微优化（过度关注小细节的优化）
* **day-to-day work**：日常工作
* **spheres of influence** 🔥：影响力范围（sphere 指领域、范围）
* **ship out**：发布、推出

---

(19) [8:20-8:54] **Yeah. To totally like imagine if you ran a small team of five developers, right? And one of them is like 17 years old, a prodigy has joined, very little sort of work experience, right? But if he or she was always saying smart things, there's no way you would ignore what they say because you know their age. Like that is just not a realistic thing. What is more likely is they aren't saying smart things, right? Or they're saying them in a way that is abrasive or hard to accept or they're saying it at the wrong time. When we're super focused, they're talking about these big ideas, right?**

完全想象一下，如果你管理一个五人的小开发团队。其中一个是 17 岁的天才少年，几乎没有工作经验。但如果他或她总是说聪明的话，你不可能因为知道他们的年龄就忽视他们说的话。那是不现实的。更可能的是他们没有说聪明的话，或者他们说话的方式很刺耳、难以接受，或者在错误的时间说。当我们超级专注的时候，他们却在谈论这些宏大的想法。

解析：
* **prodigy** /ˈprɒdɪdʒi/：天才、神童
* **abrasive** /əˈbreɪsɪv/ 🔥：刺耳的、令人不快的（形容说话方式）
* **at the wrong time**：在错误的时间

---

(20) [8:54-9:06] **So I think most people do not ignore obviously smart things that are being said. And then the question is how can you become the person that says those smart things? First you got to get the smarts, right? You got to put in the hours to get the smarts. But then you also have to know when and how to say things in a way that is timed correctly and that is accepted by the right people to make the impact that you want to make.**

所以我认为大多数人不会忽视明显聪明的观点。那问题是你怎么成为那个说聪明话的人？首先你得变聪明，对吧？你得投入时间来获得智慧。但你还得知道何时以及如何说，以正确的时机、以正确的人能接受的方式说，才能产生你想要的影响。

解析：
* **get the smarts** 🔥：变聪明、获得智慧（smarts 作名词指聪明才智）
* **put in the hours** 🔥：投入时间（指努力工作/学习）
* **timed correctly**：时机正确的

---

(21) [10:10-10:48] **My data on that is going to be about 10 plus years old, right? But I do think it's realistic to think somewhere between 1 and 5 million dollars per year based a lot on performance within level. Okay. Cool. Cool. And what's that breakdown of like salary, stock, bonus? It's overwhelmingly stock. It's because as you get more impactful in a company, more senior, the expectation is that you will affect the company's fortunes more directly. If you just join a company as a college hire straight out, nobody expects you to move the stock price, right?**

我这方面的数据大概有 10 多年了。但我认为年薪在 100 万到 500 万美元之间是现实的，这很大程度上取决于你在该级别内的表现。那工资、股票、奖金的比例是怎样的？绝大部分是股票。因为当你在公司的影响力越大、越资深，期望就是你会更直接地影响公司的命运。如果你刚从大学毕业加入公司，没人指望你能影响股价。

解析：
* **breakdown**：分解、细分比例
* **overwhelmingly** 🔥：绝大部分地、压倒性地
* **affect the company's fortunes**：影响公司的命运（fortune 指运气、命运）
* **college hire**：校招员工

---

(22) [10:48-11:18] **But if you are the lead of one of the company's large offices, it is expected that if you perform well that the company will do better. And in that case, giving you stock as your primary compensation makes a lot more sense. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Cool. That's nice to know and very incentivizing. Another perk of being at such a high level at Meta was you got to work directly with Zuckerberg on certain things. What did you learn from him and what were the things you worked on with him?**

但如果你是公司大型部门之一的负责人，期望就是如果你表现好，公司会做得更好。在这种情况下，把股票作为你的主要薪酬就更有意义了。知道这个很好，非常有激励作用。在 **Meta** 处于这么高级别的另一个好处是你能直接和 **Zuckerberg** 在某些事情上合作。你从他那里学到了什么？你们一起做了哪些事情？

解析：
* **lead**：负责人、领导
* **primary compensation**：主要薪酬
* **incentivizing**：有激励作用的
* **perk** 🔥：福利、额外好处

---

(23) [11:18-11:47] **Yeah, great question. And I'll start with leading with one observation which is you don't get to work with those people because you are that level. You became that level because you worked with them. Oh, interesting. If that makes sense. Like people don't listen to you because you're a certain level. Yeah. Okay. You earn that level by being a person who says things that people listen to and then they eventually think, "Oh, this guy says smart things." And then they automatically bump you up. Totally. Yeah.**

好问题。我先从一个观察开始——你不是因为达到了那个级别才能和那些人共事。你是因为和他们共事才达到那个级别的。哦，有意思。如果这样说能理解的话。就像人们不是因为你是某个级别才听你说话。你是通过成为一个说出人们愿意听的话的人来赢得那个级别的，然后他们最终会想："哦，这家伙说的东西很聪明。"然后他们自然就把你提上去了。完全是这样。

解析：
* **leading with**：以...开头
* **observation**：观察、看法
* **if that makes sense**：如果这样说能理解的话
* **bump you up** 🔥：把你提升上去（bump 指推、撞，这里指晋升）

---

(24) [11:47-12:18] **Working with Zuck was amazing. He is super focused, right? I think he also is, I found him genuinely well-intentioned, meaning like he genuinely seems to want what is best, right? I also found it was great that he was always brutally honest, like very straightforward, like would just tell you when he disagreed with something. Would make some observations. Let me give you a concrete example of where he was just trying to push the boundaries, right? So I along with maybe three or four other engineers were responsible for the rewrite of web messenger.**

和 **Zuck** 共事真的很棒。他超级专注。我发现他是真诚善意的，意思是他真的似乎想要什么是最好的。我也发现他总是非常直接坦诚很棒，就是很直接，会直接告诉你他不同意什么。会做一些观察。让我给你举个他试图突破边界的具体例子。我和另外三四个工程师负责重写网页版 **Messenger**。

解析：
* **super focused**：超级专注的
* **well-intentioned** 🔥：善意的、出于好意的
* **brutally honest**：极度坦诚的

---

(25) [12:18-12:47] **Okay. Back in the day and back then it integrated with email if you can believe it. So Zuck actually asked like hey why don't we go up against Gmail right? And we thought what? Gmail? Like we had like four engineers. How is this going to work right? But we discussed it for like three minutes and then he said, "Well, I wasn't really thinking that we'd do it, but I just wanted to figure out what the boundaries, right?" And so I do think he's willing to consider much more broadly the solution space than I would have myself considered.**

那时候，它和邮件是集成的，你能信吗。所以 **Zuck** 居然问："嘿，我们为什么不和 **Gmail** 竞争呢？"我们想什么？**Gmail**？我们只有四个工程师。这怎么可能行得通？但我们讨论了大概三分钟，然后他说："其实我不是真的想让我们去做，我只是想搞清楚边界在哪里。"所以我确实认为他愿意比我自己会考虑的更广泛地去考虑解决方案空间。

解析：
* **back in the day** 🔥：当年、那时候
* **go up against** 🔥：与...竞争、对抗
* **solution space**：解决方案空间（指所有可能的解决方案范围）

---

(26) [12:47-13:16] **Okay, cool. Cool. So he was trying to push the limits of what you could work on and just to think from first principles, right? Like why is it that you can't compete with Gmail? Well, it turns out there were a lot of reasons back when Facebook was that small that you couldn't, right? But at least it's worth thinking about and articulating. And were there certain things that he taught you that helped you later on in your career? I do think I still struggle to be very direct with people. So I think engaging in hard conversations was one thing that both he and Cheryl Sandberg focused a lot on encouraging people to do.**

所以他是在推动你们能做什么的极限，让你们从第一性原理思考，对吧？比如为什么你们不能和 **Gmail** 竞争？事实证明当 **Facebook** 还那么小的时候有很多原因使你不能竞争。但至少值得思考和阐述。有没有他教你的东西帮助了你后来的职业生涯？我确实认为我仍然很难对人非常直接。所以我认为参与艰难对话是他和 **Cheryl Sandberg** 都非常鼓励人们去做的一件事。

解析：
* **first principles** 🔥：第一性原理（从最基本的假设出发思考问题）
* **articulating**：阐述、表达
* **hard conversations** 🔥：艰难的对话（指需要直面问题的谈话）

---

(27) [13:16-13:46] **In the company encouraging people to give feedback openly to people you know so when you submit feedback to attach your name to the feedback. This is something that many people feel uncomfortable with, but it's something that I learned over time and I pushed myself to do. And were there any things that you learned from him that could be applicable to people who are trying to break into tech? Always be building, right? In college, he was building before he dropped out, right? And so I think you give yourself more shots at goal if you're actually doing things, right?**

在公司里鼓励人们公开给反馈，当你提交反馈时要署上你的名字。这是很多人觉得不舒服的事情，但这是我随着时间学会的，我逼自己去做。有没有你从他那里学到的东西可以适用于那些想进入科技行业的人？一直在构建，对吧？在大学时，他在辍学之前就在构建东西。所以我认为如果你真的在做事情，你就给自己更多射门的机会。

解析：
* **attach your name to**：署名于
* **push myself to do**：逼自己去做
* **break into** 🔥：进入（某行业）（这里指打入科技行业）
* **shots at goal** 🔥：射门机会（比喻尝试成功的机会）

(28) [13:46-14:14] **Many people think, "Oh, well, I'll start building once you pay me to build." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think like with the leveling, right? It goes the opposite direction. You build first and then people pay you because they love what you build. The best way to even get hired as a software engineer, people encourage just build things and post about what you're building. People will reach out to you. Yes. Totally. And the opposite thing can happen like some people will not take an internship somewhere because it pays too little. Right. And what I told my son who is doing an internship this summer, what I told him is the best places to work, you should be willing to pay them.**

很多人想："哦，你付钱让我做我才开始做。"我认为和晋升一样，它是反过来的。你先做，然后人们付钱给你因为他们喜欢你做的东西。想被雇为软件工程师的最好方法——人们鼓励你做东西并发布你在做什么。人们会来联系你。完全是。相反的情况也会发生，有些人不愿意去某处实习因为薪水太低。我告诉我今年夏天实习的儿子：最好的工作地方，你应该愿意付钱给他们。

解析：
* **leveling**：晋升、定级
* **reach out to** 🔥：联系、主动接触
* **pay too little**：薪水太低
* **be willing to pay them**：愿意付钱给他们（强调经验比薪水重要）

(29) [14:14-14:45] **Yeah. You know what I mean? Like because you want to gain the experience. Absolutely. Like if you had a chance to work with a luminary like in any field, right? In fashion, in basketball, in whatever, you should be willing to pay for that experience. And the type of person that says, "I will work for you once you pay me." Yeah. That is the person that will always be the wage earner, right? Because they are thinking not like an owner. They are thinking like a paid, a hired hand.**

你懂我意思吗？因为你想获得经验。绝对是。就像如果你有机会和任何领域的大师合作——时尚、篮球、什么都行——你应该愿意为那个经验付费。而那种说"你付我钱我才给你工作"的人，那种人永远都只会是打工人。因为他们不是像老板那样思考，他们是像雇员那样思考。

解析：
* **luminary** /ˈluːmɪnəri/ 🔥：大师、名人、杰出人物
* **wage earner**：打工人、靠工资生活的人
* **hired hand**：雇工、雇员（略带贬义）

(30) [14:45-15:08] **And I'm just curious about your time at Meta. You were a software engineer on that path. You also went to being a manager director. You influenced a lot of hiring decisions, right? When it came to interns and software engineers. A lot of our audience are interested in getting hired as a software engineering intern or software engineer. What were some hiring decisions you made that we could derive some insights to help them? I make hiring decisions very differently, I think, from how most companies I've worked for want me to hire. So, I need to put that on there, right? But I bias strongly toward figuring out things you want that are hard to change.**

我很好奇你在 **Meta** 的时光。你走的是软件工程师路线，你也做过经理和总监。你影响了很多招聘决策，对吧？关于实习生和软件工程师的。我们很多观众都想被雇为软件工程实习生或软件工程师。你做过哪些招聘决策是我们可以从中得到一些帮助他们的见解的？我做招聘决策的方式和大多数我工作过的公司希望我招聘的方式非常不同，我得先说明这点。但我非常偏向于找出那些你想要的、很难改变的特质。

解析：
* **derive insights from** 🔥：从...中得出见解
* **put that on there**：先说明/声明这一点
* **bias toward** 🔥：偏向于
* **hard to change**：难以改变的（指固有特质）
