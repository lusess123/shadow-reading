(1) [0:00-0:18] **Welcome back to another episode of Decoded. Today I'm sitting down with YC visiting partner Francois Shaard to talk about one of the most important topics in AI today, diffusion. Francois has been doing computer vision since 2012 when he started in Fei-Fei Li's lab.**

欢迎回到 **Decoded** 的新一期节目。今天我要和 **YC** 的访问合伙人 **Francois Shaard** 聊聊当今 AI 领域最重要的话题之一——扩散模型。**Francois** 从 2012 年起就在 **Fei-Fei Li**（李飞飞）的实验室开始做计算机视觉研究。

解析：
* **sitting down with** 🔥：短语，和某人坐下来深度交谈
* **visiting partner**：访问合伙人（短期顾问角色）

(2) [0:13-0:32] **And after a decade running focal systems, he's currently back at Stanford finishing his PhD working on diffusion-based world models for AGI. We're going to break down what diffusion is, how it's evolved over the past decade, and how it's used today. Francois, thanks for being here. Thank you for having me.**

在运营 **focal systems** 公司十年后，他现在回到斯坦福完成博士学业，研究基于扩散的世界模型用于 **AGI**。今天我们会拆解什么是扩散模型、它在过去十年如何演进、以及现在的应用场景。**Francois**，感谢你来。谢谢你邀请我。

解析：
* **a decade**：十年
* **diffusion-based world models**：基于扩散的世界模型
* **break down** 🔥：拆解、分解讲解

---

(3) [0:33-0:52] **Well, we just got back from NeurIPS. We just spent a lot of time talking to researchers and thinking about all the newest models out there. I think we saw diffusion pop up over and over and newer versions of these type of approaches that are not auto regressive LLM. And so I wanted to talk to you about those today.**

好，我们刚从 **NeurIPS** 回来，花了很多时间和研究人员交流，讨论最新的模型。我发现扩散模型反复出现，还有很多不是自回归 **LLM** 的新方法。所以今天想和你聊聊这些。

解析：
* **NeurIPS**：神经信息处理系统大会，顶级 AI 学术会议
* **pop up over and over** 🔥：反复出现、不断冒出来
* **auto regressive LLM**：自回归大语言模型

---

(4) [0:50-1:05] **So first, why don't we start by defining what is diffusion? Diffusion is a very fundamental machine learning framework that allows you to learn any P data, any probability of data for any domain as long as you have the data. So you're trying to learn some data distribution. That's right.**

首先，我们从定义开始吧——什么是扩散模型？扩散是一个非常基础的机器学习框架，只要你有数据，它就能让你学习任何领域的数据概率分布。所以你是在尝试学习某种数据分布。没错。

解析：
* **why don't we start by**：我们何不从...开始
* **P data / probability of data**：数据的概率分布
* **as long as** 🔥：只要...

---

(5) [1:05-1:23] **Now in a sense all LLMs or all machine learning models are about learning data distributions. How does diffusion in particular, what stance does it take or what approach does it take to being able to learn distribution? Yeah, I mean I think you can use diffusion to always do that.**

从某种意义上说，所有 **LLM** 或所有机器学习模型都是在学习数据分布。那扩散模型具体采取什么立场、什么方法来学习分布呢？是的，我觉得扩散模型一直都能做到这点。

解析：
* **in a sense**：从某种意义上说
* **what stance does it take** 🔥：它采取什么立场/态度

---

(6) [1:20-1:48] **The thing where it stands out in particular is mapping from high dimensions to high dimensions, especially in low data regimes. So, say I only have 30 images of Gary, which I actually have some code that we're going to walk through. I only have 30 images of Gary and we're in this thousand by 10,000 by 3 dimensional space and I want to map to another 3 million dimensional space with only 30 training samples and I can still do it. It's pretty powerful in that way.**

它特别突出的地方是从高维映射到高维，尤其是在数据量少的情况下。比如说，我只有 30 张 **Gary** 的照片，一会儿我们会看代码。我只有 30 张照片，我们处于一个 1000×10000×3 的维度空间，我想映射到另一个 300 万维的空间，只用 30 个训练样本我就能做到。这真的非常强大。

解析：
* **stands out** 🔥：脱颖而出、特别突出
* **low data regimes**：数据量少的场景
* **walk through** 🔥：逐步讲解、演示

---

(7) [1:48-2:05] **Okay, cool. So you have this ability to use relatively small amounts of data compared to the dimensionality to learn a P data. That's right. What's the basic process by which diffusion works? Like just walk through at a very high level, we'll walk through the math a little bit later, but at a very high level, how does this process actually work?**

好的，酷。所以你有这个能力——相对于维度来说，用很少的数据就能学习数据分布。没错。那扩散的基本过程是什么？先从高层次讲一下，之后我们再看数学细节，但现在先讲讲这个过程到底是怎么工作的？

解析：
* **compared to the dimensionality**：与维度相比
* **at a very high level** 🔥：从很高的层次、宏观地讲

---

(8) [2:05-2:32] **We take some sample of the data, an image of Anka, an image of Gary, and we just hit it with noise. And then we just keep hitting it with noise and we create this train of noised up images. It's very easy to create noisy images, right? It's hard to walk backwards and create from noise images of you or Gary. And so then we flip it and then we try to teach the model to reverse that process. And that's basically it.**

我们取一些数据样本，比如一张 **Anka** 的图片、一张 **Gary** 的图片，然后往上面加噪声。我们不断加噪声，创建出一系列加了噪声的图片。创建噪声图片很容易，对吧？但反过来从噪声中生成图片就很难了。所以我们把过程反过来，让模型学会逆转这个过程。基本上就是这样。

解析：
* **hit it with noise** 🔥：往上面加噪声（形象说法）
* **a train of**：一系列、一连串
* **flip it** 🔥：反转它

---

(9) [2:32-2:53] **Okay, cool. So it's basically a noiser and a denoiser and the denoiser is the model that you end up training. Exactly. You will basically teach your force and give it noised up images and then have it learn intermediate representations to get back to P data. Cool. Nice. And what kinds of stuff is diffusion used for today? What are some applications that it's widely deployed in?**

好的，酷。所以基本上就是一个"加噪器"和一个"去噪器"，去噪器就是你最终训练的模型。没错。你基本上就是给它加噪的图片，让它学习中间表示，然后回到原始数据分布。酷，不错。那扩散模型现在都用在哪些地方？有哪些广泛部署的应用？

解析：
* **denoiser**：去噪器（去噪模型）
* **intermediate representations** 🔥：中间表示（深度学习术语）

---

(10) [2:53-3:18] **It's honestly surprising how applicable this process is. I think the original 2015 Joshua Sohl-Dickstein paper was on CIFAR-10 which is just images. And I think it's got its roots in images, but it is far more sprawling than just images. As you've seen, Deep Mind just won the Nobel Prize for doing this exact procedure on protein folding.**

说实话，这个技术的适用性令人惊讶。我觉得 2015 年 **Joshua Sohl-Dickstein** 的原始论文是在 **CIFAR-10** 上做的，只是图片。它起源于图像，但现在的应用范围远不止图像。正如你看到的，**DeepMind** 刚刚因为将这个方法用于蛋白质折叠而获得诺贝尔奖。

解析：
* **applicable** 🔥：可应用的、适用的
* **has its roots in** 🔥：起源于、根植于
* **sprawling**：蔓延的、扩展的
* **protein folding**：蛋白质折叠

---

(11) [3:18-3:44] **You can drive cars with this with the diffusion policy paper, which is like an insane result. You can predict the weather. There's really no limit to the things that this can do. Yeah, it's pretty incredible to see. I mean we have these image and video generation models that seem to be really advancing over the last few years. Stable diffusion is the one that I think many people have heard of.**

你可以用扩散策略论文里的方法来驾驶汽车，这是一个疯狂的结果。你还可以预测天气。这个技术能做的事情真的没有限制。是的，看到这些真的很不可思议。我们有这些图像和视频生成模型，过去几年一直在快速进步。**Stable Diffusion** 是很多人听说过的。

解析：
* **diffusion policy paper**：扩散策略论文（机器人控制领域）
* **insane result** 🔥：疯狂的结果（令人难以置信的好）
* **there's no limit to**：...没有限制

---

(12) [3:41-4:05] **And then newer versions of it seem to be using this as well. And then yeah in the world of life sciences that my company was in too. I think we see this newest generation of life sciences AI companies are heavily investing in this set of technologies. There's a model called DiffDock that works really well for predicting small molecule binding to proteins and then yeah AlphaFold especially the newest AlphaFold versions use diffusion pretty heavily. It's really cool to see the same core piece of technology apply to so many different domains.**

它的新版本也在使用这项技术。在我公司所在的生命科学领域也是如此。我们看到最新一代的生命科学 AI 公司正在大力投资这些技术。有个叫 **DiffDock** 的模型，在预测小分子与蛋白质结合方面效果非常好。**AlphaFold** 尤其是最新版本大量使用了扩散模型。看到同样的核心技术应用于这么多不同领域，真的很酷。

解析：
* **life sciences**：生命科学
* **heavily investing in** 🔥：大力投资于
* **small molecule binding to proteins**：小分子与蛋白质的结合

---

(13) [4:06-4:33] **This class of models has evolved over the years and there's a whole slew of papers someone could read. So you should probably go read the papers to learn all the details. But maybe at a high level we can try to trace out a few of the key innovations that happened starting with the paper you already mentioned that now led to the newest versions of these models. So how would you map those out? Like what was the first kind of turn of the crank from this very high level diffusion process you outlined, what was the first version of that that started to work?**

这类模型这些年一直在演进，有一大堆论文可以读。如果想了解所有细节，你应该去读那些论文。但从高层次来看，我们可以尝试梳理一下从你提到的那篇论文开始的几个关键创新。你会怎么梳理这些呢？从你描述的高层次扩散过程到第一个能用的版本，第一个转折点是什么？

解析：
* **a whole slew of** 🔥：一大堆、很多
* **trace out**：梳理、追溯
* **turn of the crank** 🔥：转一下曲柄（比喻一次迭代改进）

---

(14) [4:33-4:56] **Yeah so I think that the 2015 original Joshua paper put up all the key pieces, all the key components of modern diffusion. And so now we're just playing with different things. So the scheduler, how do we add noise at what weight, that's a whole part that we can discuss. What's the loss function? Should the deep learning model condition upon x of t predict the actual data x of t minus one or should it predict the error that was just added to it?**

是的，我认为 2015 年 **Joshua** 的原始论文已经提出了现代扩散模型的所有关键组件，所以现在我们只是在玩各种变体。比如调度器——以什么权重添加噪声，这是一个可以讨论的部分。损失函数是什么？深度学习模型在给定 x(t) 的条件下，应该预测实际数据 x(t-1)，还是预测刚加上去的误差？

解析：
* **put up**：提出、建立
* **scheduler**：调度器（控制噪声添加的组件）
* **loss function** 🔥：损失函数
* **condition upon**：以...为条件

---

(15) [4:56-5:18] **Or should it predict the velocity which is the error divided by the time? Should it predict the velocity of the start and the end, that's called flow matching. There's all these different plays on what the loss function is. So in all of those the idea is still to do denoising. Yes. But the objective for each of them is somewhat different from each other and they're all pretty closely related.**

还是应该预测速度（误差除以时间）？还是应该预测起点和终点的速度——这叫做流匹配。损失函数有很多不同的玩法。所以在所有这些方法中，核心思想仍然是去噪。是的。但每种方法的目标都略有不同，它们都非常相关。

解析：
* **velocity**：速度
* **flow matching**：流匹配（一种扩散模型变体）
* **plays on** 🔥：在...上的玩法/变体
* **somewhat different**：略有不同

---

(16) [5:18-5:55] **Whether it's basically a delta between two things or the previous step or the first step. How did these all actually come together? These are a series of papers that happened one after another. Yeah I think we just kind of hill climbed on this Fréchet inception distance metric that's kind of a kooky weird measure to see how good an image is. But we just kept getting better and better on it by doing these little tricks.**

无论是两个东西之间的差值，还是前一步，还是第一步。这些是怎么结合在一起的？这是一系列接连发表的论文。是的，我觉得我们就是在 **FID**（Fréchet 初始距离）这个指标上爬山优化。这是一个有点古怪的衡量图像好坏的方法。但我们通过这些小技巧不断改进。

解析：
* **delta**：差值、变化量
* **one after another** 🔥：接连地、一个接一个
* **hill climbed** 🔥：爬山优化（逐步改进）
* **FID**：评估生成图像质量的指标
* **kooky**：古怪的、奇特的

---

(17) [5:46-6:08] **And so it turns out that predicting the actual data itself is actually quite hard and maybe predicting the error is actually easier. And predicting the velocity was even easier than that. And then predicting the global error across the entire diffusion schedule is even easier than that. And we just kept finding easier and easier ways to basically sample from noise to data.**

结果发现，预测实际数据本身其实很难，预测误差可能更容易，预测速度比那还容易，预测整个扩散调度过程中的全局误差就更容易了。我们就这样不断找到越来越简单的方法，从噪声采样生成数据。

解析：
* **it turns out that** 🔥：结果发现、原来
* **global error**：全局误差
* **diffusion schedule**：扩散调度

---

(18) [6:09-6:42] **And here when you say easier, was the ease largely driven by it was mathematically simpler or it was easier to implement and engineer or simpler to reason about? It actually is that too, but I didn't mean it that way. What I actually meant was it's easier for the model to learn. But it is also, and we'll go through some coding examples, the math actually got easier. And the code got smaller, which is actually oppositely true in most of the case of most machine learning. Things usually get more complicated.**

当你说"更容易"时，这种容易主要是因为数学上更简单，还是实现和工程上更容易，还是更容易理解？其实这些都对，但我不是那个意思。我真正的意思是模型更容易学习了。但确实，数学也变简单了——我们一会儿会看代码示例。代码也变短了，这在大多数机器学习领域其实是相反的——通常东西会变得更复杂。

解析：
* **the ease**：这种容易
* **largely driven by**：主要由...驱动
* **reason about** 🔥：推理、思考
* **oppositely true**：相反的情况

---

(19) [6:42-7:08] **I think we started with U-Nets and that was like the predominant architecture. We didn't really talk about architectures that much, but then we got into these diffusion transformers and like this cross attention mechanism and things like that. And so, yeah, we just kept getting better and better at reducing FID. Interesting. Should we dive into some code examples? Let's do it. I'll walk you through.**

我觉得我们最开始用的是 **U-Net**，那是主流架构。我们没怎么讨论架构，但后来有了扩散 **Transformer**，还有交叉注意力机制之类的。所以，我们就这样在降低 **FID** 上越来越好。有意思。我们来看看代码示例吧？开始吧。我来带你看一下。

解析：
* **U-Net**：一种常用于扩散模型的 CNN 架构
* **predominant**：主要的、占主导地位的
* **cross attention mechanism**：交叉注意力机制
* **dive into** 🔥：深入研究

---

(20) [7:03-7:35] **I made about seven of these that I implemented with varying levels of success, but the structures are going to be the same. So the Joshua paper, the non-equilibrium thermodynamics paper, you can see here are some nice images of Gary. This is what I could find online. So those are images of Gary that you've downsampled so that they're smaller. These are 64 by 64. Yeah, they're really small. This is just a very small example.**

我实现了大概七个版本，成功程度各有不同，但结构都是一样的。这是 **Joshua** 的论文，非平衡热力学论文。你可以看到这里有一些 **Gary** 的漂亮图片，这是我在网上能找到的。这些是你下采样后的图片，变得更小了。这些是 64×64 的。是的，非常小。这只是一个很小的例子。

解析：
* **varying levels of success**：不同程度的成功
* **non-equilibrium thermodynamics**：非平衡热力学
* **downsampled**：下采样（降低分辨率）

---

(21) [7:35-8:02] **64 and then I randomly augment it to create more data. Great. Because I was lazy and that was easier than downloading more images. Didn't want to get security called on you. Exactly. So, I implemented this diffusion schedule and this is probably one of the most important parts of diffusion that's difficult to comprehend. I would say that the noise schedule is actually the hardest part to understand that I really struggled with myself.**

64，然后我随机增强来创建更多数据。很好。因为我懒，这比下载更多图片容易。不想让安保找上你。没错。然后我实现了这个扩散调度，这可能是扩散模型中最重要但最难理解的部分之一。我觉得噪声调度其实是最难理解的部分，我自己也很挣扎。

解析：
* **randomly augment** 🔥：随机增强（数据增强技术）
* **get security called on you**：让安保来找你（开玩笑）
* **noise schedule** 🔥：噪声调度

---

(22) [8:02-8:26] **And so if you can see here the noise that's added from time step zero to t to 10 to 25 all the way to 100 is clearly destroying the structure. Yes. And then we want to train where you end is basically random static. Exactly. And we want to basically reverse this and from here get to here and have the model get to that point, get to this point, etc.**

你可以看到，从时间步 0 到 t、到 10、到 25、一直到 100，添加的噪声明显在破坏图像结构。是的。我们希望训练的终点基本上是随机静态噪声。没错。我们基本上想要逆转这个过程，从这里到这里，让模型到达那个点、这个点，等等。

解析：
* **random static**：随机静态噪声（像电视雪花）
* **reverse this**：逆转这个

---

(23) [8:26-8:57] **And so, the interesting part, and this is Joshua really implemented almost everything that we needed for diffusion. And there was just a few little tweaks that were missing, and he didn't scale it up. That's to me the parts that were missing. And if you see here the noise schedule. So it would make sense to me that I would have linear interpolation between the image and the noise and I would start with like one and zero, one being the image and zero being the noise. You gradually add it.**

有趣的是，**Joshua** 真的实现了扩散所需的几乎所有东西，只缺少一些小调整，而且他没有把它规模化。对我来说，这就是缺失的部分。看这里的噪声调度。我觉得在图像和噪声之间做线性插值是合理的，从 1 和 0 开始，1 代表图像，0 代表噪声。你逐渐添加。

解析：
* **tweaks** 🔥：小调整、微调
* **scale it up**：规模化、放大
* **linear interpolation**：线性插值

---

(24) [8:55-9:23] **But if you do that it actually is massively unstable because the instantaneous amount of error that you're adding is very small in the beginning. If you think about like an image on a relative basis. On a relative basis and then at the end you have to destroy all the image, to get to complete noise you need to add a lot of error. And so if you're a model and you're just looking at this little chunk of the noise schedule then you have to handle a lot of error in one step.**

但如果你这样做，实际上会非常不稳定，因为一开始你添加的瞬时误差量非常小。从相对角度来想象一张图片。从相对角度看，到最后你要彻底破坏图像变成噪声，需要添加大量误差。所以如果你是一个模型，只看噪声调度的这一小块，你需要在一步中处理大量误差。

解析：
* **massively unstable**：非常不稳定
* **instantaneous**：瞬时的、即时的
* **on a relative basis** 🔥：从相对角度

---

(25) [9:23-10:31] **And on this side of the schedule you need to handle such small amounts of error. And what you actually want is relatively constant amount of error being introduced every single time step, and the cumulative sum of all that error actually ends up looking like this curve here. That's the pink curve. Yeah. And so they call this a beta schedule. Beta is the diffusion rate, the rate of diffusion that I'm doing while I'm rolling this thing out from time zero to time T. And so you can see here the beta schedule. We usually have some beta min to beta max and then one minus that is the alpha. You can think about the beta as how much noise I'm adding at every time step. And you think about the alpha as how much is being retained. And then the term that really matters is the alpha bar and these are the weights that are used and it has this kind of like one minus sigmoid looking thing.**

而在调度的另一侧，你只需要处理很少的误差。你真正想要的是每个时间步引入相对恒定的误差量，所有误差的累积和最终看起来像这条曲线。那是粉色曲线。是的。所以他们称之为 **beta** 调度。**Beta** 是扩散速率，是我从时间 0 到时间 T 展开这个过程时的扩散速率。你可以看到这里的 **beta** 调度。我们通常有一个 **beta_min** 到 **beta_max**，然后 1 减去它就是 **alpha**。你可以把 **beta** 理解为每个时间步添加多少噪声。**Alpha** 是保留了多少。真正重要的项是 **alpha_bar**，这些是使用的权重，它看起来像 1 减去 sigmoid 的形状。

解析：
* **cumulative sum**：累积和
* **beta schedule** 🔥：beta 调度（控制噪声添加速率）
* **diffusion rate**：扩散速率
* **alpha bar (ᾱ)**：累积 alpha（所有时间步 alpha 的乘积）
* **one minus sigmoid**：1 减去 sigmoid（S 形曲线）
