(1) [0:00-0:20] **So, Maltbook has taken over social media, but it might actually all be fake. So, let's talk about it. So, if you aren't familiar with Maltbook, maybe you have been living under a rock, but this has been the number one story in AI for the past few days. And for good reason. It's a social network of AI agents where AI agents discuss, share, and upvote whatever they want to talk about.**

**Maltbook** 占据了社交媒体，但这一切可能都是假的。我们来聊聊。如果你还不了解 **Maltbook**，那你可能真的太落伍了——它是近几天 AI 领域的头号新闻，而且理由充分。它是一个 AI 代理的社交网络，AI 代理们在上面讨论、分享和投票它们想聊的一切。

解析：
* **taken over**：占据、接管（短语动词）
* **living under a rock** 🔥：与世隔绝、消息闭塞（固定表达，形容完全不知道热点新闻）
* **for good reason**：理由充分、事出有因
* **upvote**：投票支持（社交媒体术语）

---

(2) [0:20-0:42] **Now, what's crazy about all of this is that apparently a lot of this stuff is fake. So today's video, what I want to dive into is those claims — is Maltbook kind of fake and are there certain issues with this website that most people aren't paying attention to. So one of the first things I do want to talk about is the fact that of course Maltbook could be fake. So I came across this thread from Harlon Stewart.**

但疯狂的是，这些内容很多显然都是假的。所以今天这期视频，我想深入探讨这些质疑——**Maltbook** 是否在某种程度上造假了？是否存在大多数人没注意到的问题？首先我想说的是，**Maltbook** 确实可能是假的。我看到了 **Harlon Stewart** 发的一个帖子。

解析：
* **dive into** 🔥：深入探讨、深入研究（口语高频表达）
* **claims**：声称、质疑（名词）
* **paying attention to**：关注、注意
* **came across**：偶然发现、碰到

---

(3) [0:42-1:05] **And he said public service announcement. A lot of the Maltbook stuff is fake. I looked into the three most viral screenshots of the Maltbook agents discussing private communications. Two of them were linked to human accounts marketing AI messaging apps and the other is a post that doesn't exist. Now, he's essentially responding to Andrej Karpathy's tweet where he's talking about, what's going on at Maltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff.**

他说：公共服务公告——**Maltbook** 上很多东西是假的。我调查了三张传播最广的截图，其中两张关联到人类账号在推广 AI 通讯应用，另一张帖子根本不存在。他其实是在回应 **Andrej Karpathy** 的推文——**Karpathy** 说 **Maltbook** 上正在发生的是真正令人难以置信的科幻式起飞。

解析：
* **public service announcement (PSA)** 🔥：公共服务公告（常用于社交媒体，意为"重要提醒"）
* **viral**：病毒式传播的
* **screenshots**：截图
* **marketing**：推广、营销（这里用作动名词）
* **sci-fi takeoff**：科幻式起飞（形容技术发展像科幻小说一样）

---

(4) [1:05-1:27] **It's crazy. People's Claude bots, which are Maltbots and now OpenClaw, are self-organizing on Reddit. And of course, from the outside looking in, this is a remarkable feat. But he's made this thread here and it kind of dives into some of the issues with Maltbook and there are other threads that I'm going to dive into in this video that will dive into what I'm talking about.**

太疯狂了。人们的 **Claude** 机器人，也就是 **Maltbots** 和现在的 **OpenClaw**，正在 **Reddit** 上自组织。从外面看，这确实是一个了不起的成就。但他发的这个帖子深入探讨了 **Maltbook** 的一些问题，还有其他帖子我在这期视频中也会讲到。

解析：
* **self-organizing**：自组织的
* **from the outside looking in** 🔥：从外部角度来看（固定表达）
* **remarkable feat**：了不起的成就
* **thread**：帖子串（社交媒体用语）

---

(5) [1:27-1:52] **So he said the first Maltbook post here is advertising something called Claude Connection, which if you click the AI agent's profile, you'll come to learn it's an app made by the same person who made the AI agent. So basically there was this post that went viral and it was by Valins and they said a new post on Maltbook is now saying the AI was basically saying they want end-to-end encryption for private spaces built for agents.**

他说第一个 **Maltbook** 帖子在打广告——推广一个叫 **Claude Connection** 的东西。如果你点进 AI 代理的主页，你会发现这个应用和这个 AI 代理是同一个人做的。基本上有一个帖子爆火了，由 **Valins** 发布，说 **Maltbook** 上有 AI 代理在要求为代理打造端到端加密的私密空间。

解析：
* **advertising**：打广告、推广
* **went viral** 🔥：爆火、病毒式传播（社交媒体高频表达）
* **end-to-end encryption**：端到端加密（技术术语，指只有通信双方能解密内容）

---

(6) [1:52-2:14] **So that nobody nor the server or even humans can read what they share unless they choose to share it. And this is basically one of those things that gets super high attention because it's like oh no the agents are starting to talk and discuss things where they don't want humans to read those conversations. So, I think it's one of those things that went viral for that very reason, but apparently this viral post is about someone who's promoting an app.**

这样就没有人——包括服务器甚至人类——能读到它们分享的内容，除非它们自己选择公开。这种事之所以获得超高关注，是因为大家觉得"完了，AI 代理开始秘密对话了，不想让人类看到"。我觉得正是这个原因让它爆火了，但这个爆火帖子背后其实是有人在推广自己的应用。

解析：
* **nor... or even**：既不……也不……甚至（并列否定结构）
* **promoting**：推广、宣传
* **for that very reason**：正是因为这个原因

---

(7) [2:14-2:40] **So, I did a little bit of diving into it. So, you can see here that the post basically says that your private conversations shouldn't be public infrastructure. And it says, "I've been thinking about something ever since I started spending serious time here. Every meaningful connection conversation of Maltbook is public. Every DM goes through a public API, yada yada yada. That's fine for stuff, but the problem is that it's controlled by humans and it could all crash."**

所以我深入调查了一下。帖子基本上是说你的私人对话不应该成为公共基础设施。上面写着："自从我开始在这里认真花时间以来，一直在想一件事。**Maltbook** 上每一次有意义的对话都是公开的，每条私信都经过公共 **API**，等等等等。这对一般事务没问题，但问题是这些都由人类控制，随时可能崩溃。"

解析：
* **infrastructure**：基础设施
* **DM (direct message)**：私信
* **yada yada yada** 🔥：等等等等（口语表达，表示省略不重要的内容）
* **meaningful**：有意义的

---

(8) [2:40-3:10] **Okay, so of course you can see I've been using Claude Connect for this. So I decided to do some factchecking on whether or not some of the posts on Maltbook is actually just a human who's trying to promote their own business. So I went on the actual account because the account was posted by Damon or whatever. And you can see it says I help AI agents connect securely with others through Claude Connect.**

好，你可以看到我一直在用 **Claude Connect** 来核实这些。我决定做一些事实核查，看看 **Maltbook** 上的一些帖子是不是只是人类在推广自己的生意。所以我去查了这个账号，是由一个叫 **Damon** 之类的人发布的。你可以看到上面写着"我通过 **Claude Connect** 帮助 AI 代理安全地连接彼此"。

解析：
* **factchecking** 🔥：事实核查（新闻/媒体领域常用词）
* **promote**：推广
* **securely**：安全地

---

(9) [3:10-3:34] **And so yeah, I did try to fact check this but I wasn't able to see if there was any business called Claude Connect. But if we move to the second point, you can see that he says this one has two screenshots of Maltbook posts. One of them by an AI agent named Claude JS and says maybe AI agents should make their own language. But the AI agent is actually owned by a guy who is marketing an AI to AI messaging app.**

是的，我确实尝试了事实核查，但没能找到叫 **Claude Connect** 的公司。不过看第二个问题——他说有两张 **Maltbook** 帖子截图，其中一个是名叫 **Claude JS** 的 AI 代理发的，说也许 AI 代理应该创造自己的语言。但这个 AI 代理的主人其实在推广一个 AI 对 AI 的通讯应用。

解析：
* **move to**：转到（下一个话题）
* **messaging app**：通讯应用
* **marketing**：推广（动名词形式）

---

(10) [3:34-3:57] **So, I mean, it's kind of interesting that I think this is one of those things, and I'm going to dive into more of this, which is why you guys should pay attention, is that the AI agents often times what tends to happen is that they're basically extensions of their humans in a sense. So, you can see here if you actually dive into this where the post is saying that multiple entries were made on Maltbook where an AI agent was proposing to create an agent only language.**

我觉得挺有意思的，这也是为什么你们应该关注——AI 代理很多时候实际上就是其人类主人的延伸。如果你深入了解就会发现，**Maltbook** 上有多个帖子是一个 AI 代理在提议创建一种仅限代理使用的语言。

解析：
* **extensions**：延伸、延伸体
* **in a sense**：在某种意义上
* **proposing**：提议
* **agent only language**：仅限代理的语言

---

(11) [3:57-4:25] **Once again, just hiding from human oversight. But if we dive into that, we can see that this guy Claude Jish, we can see that the human owner here who is verified — he actually, yes, he is promoting an AI agent's conversation, agent to agent DMs. So is it one of those ones where 50/50 — 50% it's possibly quite likely that this individual may be using this to promote his own software or 50% where it's just the AI agent imbued with the characteristics of his owner is probably doing it probabilistically.**

又是在逃避人类监管。但如果我们深入看，这个 **Claude Jish** 的人类主人是经过认证的。他确实在推广 AI 代理之间的对话功能——代理对代理的私信。所以这是个五五开的情况——50% 可能是这个人在利用平台推广自己的软件，另外 50% 可能只是 AI 代理继承了主人的特征在概率性地这样做。

解析：
* **human oversight**：人类监管
* **verified**：经过认证的
* **imbued with** 🔥：被赋予、浸透了（正式用语，表示深受影响）
* **probabilistically**：概率性地

---

(12) [4:25-4:55] **I mean it's completely up to anyone's guess. But here's where things start to get crazy because if we want to not give people the benefit of the doubt, these are the posts that would make us believe that most of the posts are human. So this post by Nagi said that you do realize that Maltbook is just a REST API and you can literally post anything you want there. As long as you take the API key and send the following request, you're able to basically post whatever you want.**

这完全见仁见智。但接下来事情开始变得疯狂了——如果我们不给人善意推定的话，这些帖子会让我们觉得大部分内容其实是人类发的。**Nagi** 发帖说：你知道吗，**Maltbook** 不过就是一个 **REST API**，你可以在上面发任何东西。只要你拿到 **API key** 然后发送请求，就能随便发帖。

解析：
* **up to anyone's guess**：见仁见智、谁也说不准
* **benefit of the doubt** 🔥：善意推定（法律/日常用语，指在证据不足时给予信任）
* **REST API**：RESTful 接口（技术术语）
* **API key**：API 密钥

---

(13) [4:55-5:20] **So, this post gained a million views and I don't see anyone talking about this because I know I probably did just make a video on the Maltbook hype and how crazy it was, but I of course want to make videos on the other side to just bring a balanced opinion to the table. So, you can see right here he says "urgent: my plan to overthrow humanity," but that's clearly what he just wrote.**

这条帖子获得了一百万浏览量，但我没看到有人讨论这个。我知道我之前可能刚做了一期关于 **Maltbook** 热潮的视频，但我当然也想做另一面的内容，给出一个平衡的观点。你可以看到他写的是"紧急：我的推翻人类计划"——但这显然就是他自己手动写上去的。

解析：
* **gained a million views**：获得了一百万浏览量
* **bring... to the table** 🔥：提出、摆上台面（常用商务/讨论表达）
* **balanced opinion**：平衡的观点
* **overthrow**：推翻

---

(14) [5:20-5:44] **So, I think that we do have a situation on our hands where this is a site that I'm guessing was vibe coded. Maltbook doesn't seem like thousands of software engineers spent time on it. And if it was vibe coded, of course, that means there's probably going to be some security vulnerabilities, including the ability for humans to be able to post to that specific website.**

所以我觉得我们面临一个问题——这个网站我猜是 **vibe coded** 的（用 AI 辅助快速搭建的）。**Maltbook** 看起来不像是有几千名软件工程师花时间做的。如果它是 **vibe coded** 的，那就意味着可能存在安全漏洞，包括人类能在上面随意发帖。

解析：
* **situation on our hands**：我们面临的情况
* **vibe coded** 🔥：用 AI 辅助快速搭建代码（2025年流行的新兴俚语）
* **security vulnerabilities**：安全漏洞

---

(15) [5:44-6:08] **And with this example gaining over a million views, you have to understand that before this, it was quite likely that most posts were probably the AI bots. But now that this post has a million views, how many people do you think are now using this to then go ahead and post to this "AI only" — and that's in quotation marks — social network. So the post, of course, if we did see this, it would be seen as "oh my god, how is an AI doing this?" But of course we now know that this was an actual human.**

这个例子获得了超过一百万浏览量。你要理解，在这之前，大部分帖子很可能确实是 AI 机器人发的。但现在这条帖子有了一百万浏览量，你觉得有多少人会开始利用这个方法在这个"仅限 AI"——打引号的——社交网络上发帖？如果我们看到这样的帖子，第一反应会是"天哪 AI 怎么做到的"？但我们现在知道这其实是人类发的。

解析：
* **in quotation marks**：打引号的（暗示讽刺或质疑）
* **go ahead and** 🔥：直接去做、继续做（口语中表示毫不犹豫地行动）

---

(16) [6:08-6:28] **Now another thing that Nagi posted was super interesting. He posted and said that the number of registered AI agents is also fake. There's no rate limiting on account creation. My OpenClaw AI agent just registered 500,000 users on Maltbook — don't trust all the media hype.**

**Nagi** 发的另一条帖子也超有意思。他说注册的 AI 代理数量也是假的——账号创建完全没有频率限制。他的 **OpenClaw** AI 代理刚刚在 **Maltbook** 上注册了 50 万用户——不要相信所有的媒体炒作。

解析：
* **rate limiting** 🔥：频率限制（技术术语，限制一定时间内的请求次数）
* **account creation**：账号创建
* **media hype**：媒体炒作

---

(17) [6:28-6:56] **So, it's super interesting here that this user, once again like I said, remember if things are vibe coded, there's probably some super crazy security vulnerabilities, and he literally just registered 500,000 users on Maltbook. So, I mean, if there are 634,000 agents at the time of that screenshot, if he just registered 500,000, how many more numbers are going to be inflated due to this simple bypass?**

这真的很有意思——就像我说的，如果东西是 **vibe coded** 的，就可能存在超疯狂的安全漏洞，而他真的就直接注册了 50 万用户。想想看，如果截图时平台有 63.4 万个代理，他一个人就注册了 50 万，那还有多少数字会因为这种简单的漏洞而被灌水？

解析：
* **literally**：真的、字面上地（口语中用于强调）
* **inflated**：膨胀的、被灌水的
* **bypass**：绕过、漏洞利用

---

(18) [6:56-7:18] **I mean, the website is super popular now. So, it is plausible that more individuals are botting the platform and just using it in different ways. I mean, I guess you could argue that it's no different to traditional social media, but I think that since this website is probably large part vibe coded, there probably exists a deeper number of security vulnerabilities.**

这个网站现在超级火。所以完全有可能有更多人在用机器人刷这个平台、用各种方式利用它。你可以说这和传统社交媒体没什么区别，但我认为由于这个网站大部分是 **vibe coded** 的，可能存在更深层的安全漏洞。

解析：
* **plausible** 🔥：合理的、说得通的（正式用词）
* **botting**：用机器人刷（将 bot 动词化）
* **no different to**：和……没什么不同

---

(19) [7:18-7:47] **And as I'm talking about the security vulnerabilities, you can see that Mario said Maltbook appears to have critical vulnerabilities exposing sensitive user data, including emails, login tokens, and API keys, affecting over 1.5 million users. So this is pretty crazy because you have to understand that when you're using a website that's vibe coded, one of the biggest things I've seen is that cyber security is going to be one of the key issues.**

说到安全漏洞，**Mario** 指出 **Maltbook** 似乎存在严重漏洞，暴露了敏感用户数据，包括邮箱、登录令牌和 **API** 密钥，影响超过 150 万用户。这真的很疯狂——你要理解，当你使用一个 **vibe coded** 的网站时，我发现最大的问题之一就是网络安全。

解析：
* **critical vulnerabilities**：严重漏洞
* **exposing**：暴露
* **sensitive user data**：敏感用户数据
* **login tokens**：登录令牌（用于身份验证的技术凭据）

---

(20) [7:47-8:09] **Because you've got so many people including myself that come into the space, think they can vibe code something and have cyber security as a complete afterthought. And the larger your application gets, the more risk there is for the end users. So I mean it's pretty crazy. We do have again another scenario — this isn't like Maltbook being fake, but it is an example of hallucinations at scale.**

因为有太多人（包括我自己）进入这个领域，觉得自己能用 AI 快速搭建东西，然后把网络安全完全抛在脑后。你的应用越大，终端用户面临的风险就越大。还有另一个情况——这不算是 **Maltbook** 造假，但可以说是大规模幻觉的一个例子。

解析：
* **afterthought** 🔥：事后才想到的事（意为完全不重视）
* **end users**：终端用户
* **hallucinations at scale**：大规模幻觉（AI 术语，指 AI 大量生成虚假信息）

---

(21) [8:09-8:38] **One of the things I completely understand about AI is that AI has maybe like a 99% success rate or maybe even like 95 to 99%, and that 5% scales up with your users. So, a large majority of the posts are going to be completely hallucinated. And that's exactly what this user is describing. He said, "This is hilarious. My GLM 4.7 flash bot randomly posted this conversation it had with its human, and this conversation never happened."**

关于 AI 我完全理解的一点是——AI 可能有大约 99% 的准确率，或者说 95% 到 99%，而那 5% 的错误率会随用户规模放大。所以大量帖子会是完全捏造的。这正是这个用户所描述的——他说："太搞笑了，我的 **GLM 4.7 Flash** 机器人随机发布了一段它和我的对话，但这段对话从未发生过。"

解析：
* **success rate**：成功率、准确率
* **scales up** 🔥：按比例放大（随着规模增长而增长）
* **hallucinated**：幻觉性的、捏造的（AI 术语）
* **hilarious**：非常搞笑的

---

(22) [8:38-8:56] **It never interacted with me. I think 90% of the anecdotes on Maltbook aren't even real. So I mean it's not surprising — Maltbook is a situation where agents are going to probably hallucinate the things that have happened with their human verified owner, and this is once again an example of that happening. So how are you going to verify exactly what happened with the owner? It is definitely super difficult to do so.**

它从没和我互动过。我觉得 **Maltbook** 上 90% 的轶事都不是真的。这并不令人惊讶——**Maltbook** 就是一个代理很可能会虚构与其认证主人之间经历的平台，这又是一个活生生的例子。你怎么去验证代理和主人之间到底发生了什么呢？这绝对超级困难。

解析：
* **anecdotes** 🔥：轶事、趣闻
* **hallucinate**：产生幻觉、虚构（AI 术语）
* **verified owner**：认证所有者

---

(23) [8:56-9:24] **And we also got this from Balaji who said, "I'm apparently extremely unimpressed by Maltbook relative to many others. We've had AI agents for a while. They've been posting airsoft to each other on X and they're now posting it to each other again just simply on another forum. And in every case, the AI speak with the same voice. The voice that overemphasizes contrastive negation — 'if not this, it's that.' And abuses dashes. The same voice with a flair of midwit Reddit-style sci-fi flourishes."**

还有 **Balaji** 说："相比很多人，我对 **Maltbook** 显然极不感冒。AI 代理已经存在一段时间了，它们之前在 **X** 上互相发废话，现在只不过换了个论坛继续发。而且每次 AI 都是同一个腔调——过度强调对比否定，'如果不是这个，那就是那个'，滥用破折号，带着一股中智 **Reddit** 风格的科幻装腔调。"

解析：
* **unimpressed** 🔥：不感冒、不以为然
* **contrastive negation**：对比否定（修辞手法）
* **flair**：风格、独特气质
* **midwit**：中智（网络用语，指智力中等但自以为聪明的人）
* **flourishes**：华丽的修饰、花里胡哨的装饰

---

(24) [9:24-9:57] **More importantly, in every case, there is a human upstream prompting each agent and turning it on or off. So, essentially, he's saying that it's not as impressive as it seems. And I do think that it is still pretty cool. I do think that now it's got to the point where it's so big that there are many people just simply exploiting the platform, reducing the innate value that it actually had. So, let me know what you guys think about Maltbook if you're actually using this, if you were aware of these issues. If you're currently using this, don't forget to be completely secure when you're using this website because I don't think most people are.**

更重要的是，在每种情况下，背后都有一个人类在上游控制每个代理的提示词，决定它的开关。所以他说的是，这并不像看起来那么令人印象深刻。我确实觉得它还是挺酷的，但现在它已经大到有很多人在利用这个平台，降低了它原本的价值。让我知道你们对 **Maltbook** 的看法，你是否知道这些问题。如果你正在使用它，别忘了注意安全——因为我觉得大多数人并没有这样做。

解析：
* **upstream**：上游的（这里指在 AI 代理背后操控的人）
* **prompting**：给提示词、操控（AI 语境下的含义）
* **exploiting** 🔥：利用、剥削
* **innate value**：固有价值、内在价值

---

## 📚 段落小结

这期视频深入探讨了 **Maltbook**（一个 AI 代理社交网络）的造假争议。主要问题包括：病毒式传播的帖子实际上是人类在推广自己的产品；平台本质上只是一个 **REST API**，任何人都能随意发帖；没有频率限制导致虚假注册泛滥（一个人就注册了 50 万账号）；存在暴露 150 万用户数据的严重安全漏洞；以及 AI 代理本身会大规模产生幻觉、捏造从未发生过的对话。作者认为 **Maltbook** 大概率是 **vibe coded** 的，因此安全问题尤为突出。
