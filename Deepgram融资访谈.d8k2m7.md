未来 5 年，可能 70-80% 的 token 都会是实时的。所以他们同时都注意到了这一点。我们大约一年前宣布 **Deepgram** 实现了正向现金流。

解析：
* **transform into**：转变成
* **cash flow positive**：正向现金流 🔥（收入 > 支出）

---

(13) [3:38-3:56] **So we weren't like in need of money like most AI companies most frontier AI companies are burning money like crazy you know they have uh negative margins they're just going to town lighting money on fire. That's not the situation that Deepgram was in.**

所以我们不像大多数 AI 公司那样急需资金。大多数前沿 AI 公司都在疯狂烧钱，他们的利润率是负的，简直就是在使劲烧钱。**Deepgram** 不是那种情况。

* **cement** /sɪˈment/：动词，巩固、加强 🔥
* **go public**：上市（公司股票公开交易）🔥
* **thought process**：思考过程

---

(16) [4:24-4:47] **And um the raise though is for those three things. It's to expand our core product um to work on Neuroplex to um to keep developing our perception models and our voice generation models um but then to expand to 100 languages and dialects both in speech generation and in perception.**

这次融资是为了三件事：扩展我们的核心产品，继续开发 **Neuroplex**、我们的感知模型和语音生成模型；然后扩展到 100 种语言和方言，包括语音生成和感知两个方面。

解析：
* **perception models**：感知模型（语音识别等）
* **voice generation models**：语音生成模型（TTS 等）
* **dialects** /ˈdaɪəlekts/：名词，方言

---

(17) [4:47-5:07] **And then to um acquire the compute and uh complements to our platform uh that will you know that will put us in a great position. So all those things came together at once. Um, it's helpful though that voice AI went mainstream and then everybody sort of recognized the value here.**

最后是获取算力和平台的补充能力，这会让我们处于非常有利的位置。所以所有这些事情同时发生了。语音 AI 走向主流确实很有帮助，然后大家都认识到了这里的价值。

解析：
* **compute**：名词，算力 🔥（AI 领域常用）
* **complements**：名词，补充、配套
* **come together**：聚集、汇合

---

(18) [5:02-5:24] **Yeah, what a time to pour fuel on the fire. I think that's something I've always admired about Deepgram is that you guys have like had this vision for the last eight or nine years of um really like how do you get like voice AI into production mainstream.**

是啊，正是火上浇油的好时机。我一直很佩服 **Deepgram** 的一点是，你们过去八九年一直有这个愿景：如何让语音 AI 真正进入生产主流。

解析：
* **pour fuel on the fire**：火上浇油（这里是正面意思：抓住时机加大投入）🔥
* **admire** /ədˈmaɪr/：动词，钦佩、佩服
* **vision**：名词，愿景

---

(19) [5:18-5:39] **And that this is going to be the mode of like how we interface with computers and you guys have been at it for the past nine years and so your fundamentals are so strong and I think the research is really there and that's just an amazing part of your team.**

(21) [5:54-6:18] **Um, you know, it's funny. A lot of companies build on top of Deepgram and they'll come to us like years later and say um so we're wondering about this architecture design because we haven't even built error handling into our API calls to Deepgram because they fail so infrequently.**

这很有趣。很多公司在 **Deepgram** 之上构建产品，几年后他们来找我们说：我们在考虑这个架构设计，因为我们甚至没有为调用 **Deepgram** 的 API 构建错误处理机制，因为它们很少失败。

解析：
* **error handling**：错误处理（编程术语）
* **infrequently** /ɪnˈfriːkwəntli/：副词，很少地

---

(22) [6:16-6:40] **And I'm just like guys you got to use like standard engineering practices here. Our systems are way more reliable than other um AI systems, especially speech systems. But that is just a testament to the underlying models that are built and the engineering that is done at Deepgram and just how reliable the system is.**

我就说：伙计们，你们还是得遵循标准工程实践啊。我们的系统比其他 AI 系统可靠得多，尤其是语音系统。但这恰恰证明了 **Deepgram** 底层模型和工程的质量，以及系统有多可靠。

(23) [6:40-7:02] **Um but I think that's what's needed in order to be the backbone of this next generation of products. So I look at the world there's 8 billion people in it. There's just a tiny bit of penetration right now with voice as the user interface. It's going to 100x or more.**

但我认为这正是成为下一代产品骨干所需要的。世界上有 80 亿人，目前语音作为用户界面的渗透率还非常低，未来将增长 100 倍甚至更多。

解析：
* **backbone**：名词，骨干、支柱 🔥
* **penetration** /ˌpenəˈtreɪʃn/：名词，渗透率 🔥
* **100x**：100 倍

---

(24) [7:00-7:26] **And uh if we're standing around saying uh we have to build 500 billion dollar data centers in the center of Texas in order to do this like I that doesn't make sense to me. Um there you can supply this without burning up all of the energy and water in the world. Deepgram's models and platform is a demonstration of this.**

如果我们说必须在德克萨斯州中心建造 5000 亿美元的数据中心才能做到这一点，我觉得这不合理。你可以在不耗尽世界上所有能源和水资源的情况下提供这种服务。**Deepgram** 的模型和平台就是这一点的证明。

解析：
* **data center**：数据中心
* **burn up**：耗尽、烧光
* **demonstration**：名词，证明、演示

---

(25) [7:18-7:42] **And I think this raise and our partners validate that too. They get the best models and access to low latency and high throughput and really reliable products. But by the way our models are the most efficient and they're the most friendly to the environment and they also make sense from a business perspective.**

我认为这次融资和我们的合作伙伴也验证了这一点。他们获得了最好的模型、低延迟、高吞吐量和真正可靠的产品。顺便说一下，我们的模型是最高效的，对环境最友好，从商业角度也很有意义。

解析：
* **validate** /ˈvælɪdeɪt/：动词，验证 🔥
* **low latency**：低延迟 🔥
* **high throughput**：高吞吐量 🔥
* **make sense**：有意义、合理

---

(26) [7:42-8:05] **So I think there's a new brand of company that will be coming out from an AI company perspective that puts all of those together like all the complaints that people have about AI right now. I think you can actually address all of them. I mean, I can tell you you already can in voice this is what we do at Deepgram.**

所以我认为会出现一种新类型的 AI 公司，把所有这些结合在一起，解决人们目前对 AI 的所有抱怨。我可以告诉你，在语音领域已经可以做到了，这就是我们在 **Deepgram** 做的事情。

解析：
* **a new brand of**：一种新类型的
* **address**：动词，解决（问题）🔥
* **complaints**：名词，抱怨

---

(27) [8:01-8:23] **But there's going to be a different mode of operation for companies instead of just build bigger, burn faster, burn bright. There's a sustainable AI company business model out there and I'm happy that we're doing really well with it. Yeah. No, and I think that's where like the testament of working on this problem and knowing it so deeply that you have that maturity of the products.**

公司将有一种不同的运营模式，而不是只追求"建得更大、烧得更快、烧得更亮"。可持续的 AI 公司商业模式是存在的，我很高兴我们做得很好。是的，我认为这就是深耕这个问题的价值所在，因为你们对它了解得如此深刻，产品才有这种成熟度。

解析：
* **mode of operation**：运营模式
* **sustainable** /səˈsteɪnəbl/：形容词，可持续的 🔥
* **maturity** /məˈtjʊrəti/：名词，成熟度 🔥

---

(28) [8:24-8:57] **I mean we see this in our benchmarks the reliability. We do continuous monitoring of all these different models and I think Deepgram consistently has some of the most consistent performance across all which again with real time if you have many turns reliability is only like exploding in terms of how important that reliability is because you're not just making one API call like when you Google search you have to get it right that one time but with voice AI you have to get it right a hundred times within a call and so yeah that reliability just totally compounds.**

我们在基准测试中看到了这种可靠性。我们对所有这些不同的模型进行持续监控，**Deepgram** 始终拥有最一致的性能表现。在实时场景中，如果你有很多轮对话，可靠性的重要性就呈爆炸式增长。因为你不是只发一次 API 调用，像 Google 搜索那样只需要那一次正确就行。但语音 AI，你需要在一通电话中做对一百次。所以可靠性确实是完全复合累积的。

解析：
* **benchmarks**：名词，基准测试 🔥
* **continuous monitoring**：持续监控
* **consistent performance**：一致的性能
* **compound** /kəmˈpaʊnd/：动词，复合、累积 🔥

---

(29) [8:57-9:26] **Yeah it's nuts. What do you um what are you seeing out there uh from like what we're seeing that for sure that like you reduce your um you know go from three nines to four nines or go from two nines to three nines or whatever. Because you're compounding um you like the user experience gets so much better. As you reduce latency too the that latency stacks up linearly etc. like all these things being worked on at once um is making the experience better.**

是的，太疯狂了。你们看到外面是什么情况？我们确实看到，当你把可用性从三个九提升到四个九，或者从两个九提升到三个九，因为是复合效应，用户体验会变得好很多。当你降低延迟时，延迟也是线性累加的。所有这些同时改进，正在让体验变得更好。

解析：
* **three nines / four nines**：三个九 / 四个九（可用性指标，99.9% / 99.99%）🔥
* **stack up**：累加
* **linearly** /ˈlɪniərli/：副词，线性地

---

(30) [9:29-9:55] **But you see so many different people building and testing you know, how's it going? What's the state of voice AI interfaces right now? Yeah, I mean definitely latency like to your point or all of these things when you make gains at one turn then they compound either negatively or positively. Like if you cut latency by 10% on any one turn, that adds up across the whole conversation. So now you can cut the entire length of the conversation.**

但你们看到这么多人在构建和测试，现在的情况怎么样？语音 AI 界面现在是什么状态？是的，就像你说的，延迟确实——所有这些东西，当你在一轮对话中获得提升，它们会正向或负向复合。如果你在任何一轮对话中减少 10% 的延迟，这会在整个对话中累加起来。这样你就可以缩短整个对话的时长。

解析：
* **what's the state of**：...现在是什么状态
* **make gains**：获得提升
* **add up**：累加

---

(31) [9:55-10:21] **And then I think what's been really cool recently is just how reliable these models have gotten, how low latency has become less of an issue. We've seen that over the course of the last year and a half. I think a year and a half ago just getting a voice model to have a conversation that was not incredibly high latency was really really hard.**

最近真正酷的是这些模型变得多么可靠，延迟已经不再是那么大的问题。过去一年半我们看到了这一点。一年半前，让语音模型进行一次延迟不那么高的对话真的很难。

解析：
* **over the course of**：在...期间
* **become less of an issue**：不再是那么大的问题 🔥

---

(32) [10:21-10:43] **And I think today now people are focusing a lot more on these complex architectures of how can I have failover mechanisms to get to those multiple nines of reliability or how can I have background agents to add guardrails? How can I be doing even more like pushing the bounds of what voice agents can do I think will always be there. So we'll always be fighting latency.**

我认为今天人们更多地关注这些复杂架构：如何实现故障转移机制来达到多个九的可靠性，如何用后台代理添加护栏，如何做更多来突破语音代理能做什么的边界——我认为这些追求会一直存在。所以我们将永远在与延迟作战。

解析：
* **failover mechanisms**：故障转移机制 🔥
* **guardrails**：名词，护栏（AI 领域指安全限制）🔥
* **background agents**：后台代理
* **push the bounds**：突破边界

---

(33) [10:38-11:00] **Um, but what people can do is much more along those lines. I think with Neuroplex, um, I'm really excited about like your vision of Neuroplex, but how do you think that this raise is going to help you guys to invest even more in like which models do you think you'll be spending even more energy on other than you guys are obviously very known for transcription? Um, where do you think you guys are going next?**

但人们能做的事情在这些方面多了很多。说到 **Neuroplex**，我对你们的 **Neuroplex** 愿景真的很兴奋。你觉得这次融资会如何帮助你们加大投入？除了你们显然最知名的转录之外，你们认为会在哪些模型上投入更多精力？你们下一步要往哪个方向走？

解析：
* **along those lines**：沿着那些方向、在那方面 🔥
* **transcription** /trænˈskrɪpʃn/：名词，转录（语音转文字）🔥
* **be known for**：因...而闻名 🔥

---

(34) [11:29-11:51] **Um, and when you are when you're perceiving something, so for instance, like listening to audio, there's a portion of your brain that is doing that perception, but then it sort of hands that off, but through a it's it's not transcribing it in text. I can tell you that, and then handing it off to another part of your brain.**

当你在感知某些东西的时候，比如听音频，你大脑的某个部分在做感知，然后它会把这个信息传递出去。但我可以告诉你，它不是把音频转录成文字，然后再传递给大脑的另一个部分。

解析：
* **perceive** /pərˈsiːv/：动词，感知
* **portion**：名词，部分
* **hand off**：传递、交接 🔥
* **transcribe**：动词，转录

---

(35) [11:46-12:03] **It's giving it this like uh this impression through the only thing that I could equate it to in deep learning is uh like a rich embedding. It's passing over this like rich embedding to another part of your brain through the white matter and then that part of your brain is processing that.**

它传递的是一种"印象"——在深度学习中我能类比的唯一东西就是一个丰富的嵌入向量。它通过白质把这个丰富的嵌入向量传递给大脑的另一个部分，然后那个部分处理它。

解析：
* **equate to**：等同于、类比为 🔥
* **rich embedding**：丰富的嵌入向量
* **white matter**：白质（大脑神经纤维）
* **pass over**：传递

---

(36) [12:01-12:22] **And you know thinking deeply oh what should I respond with oh maybe they mean this maybe they mean that etc. Oh okay actually now now I know what to do and then that hands it off to another part of your brain where uh you generate your vocal movements push out the air say what you're going to say or move your hands or click a button and send something etc.**

然后深入思考：哦，我应该怎么回应？也许他们是这个意思，也许是那个意思等等。好的，现在我知道该怎么做了。然后它再把信息传递给大脑的另一个部分，在那里你生成声带运动、推出空气、说出你要说的话，或者移动手、点击按钮发送消息等等。

解析：
* **respond with**：用...回应
* **vocal movements**：声带运动
* **push out the air**：推出空气（发声过程）

---

(37) [12:26-12:49] **And um I think that you know we should use that biology inspired um architecture in building efficient systems. You know we already have human brains that run on like 25 to 50 watts and can do this and uh do an extremely complicated task uh multitask you know do all these things and understand context have obviously a humanlike conversation.**

我认为我们应该用这种受生物学启发的架构来构建高效系统。人类大脑只用 25 到 50 瓦的功率就能做到这些，能执行极其复杂的任务、多任务处理、理解上下文、进行类人对话。

解析：
* **biology inspired**：受生物学启发的 🔥
* **run on X watts**：以 X 瓦功率运行
* **multitask**：动词，多任务处理
* **humanlike**：形容词，类人的

---

(38) [12:46-13:06] **This is what humans do. Um so you have an example proof already. So let's use that. And this is what Neuroplex is all about. Um so it's not just speech to text plus an LLM plus text to speech. Um it's uh context passing throughout all of it, but it's a modular architecture that you uh that is not a blackbox.**

这就是人类做的事情。所以你已经有了一个现成的证明。让我们利用它。这就是 **Neuroplex** 的核心。它不只是语音转文字加 LLM 加文字转语音。它是在整个过程中传递上下文，而且是一个模块化架构，不是黑盒。

解析：
* **example proof**：现成的证明
* **speech to text / text to speech**：语音转文字 / 文字转语音（STT/TTS）
* **context passing**：上下文传递 🔥
* **modular architecture**：模块化架构 🔥
* **blackbox**：黑盒（无法理解内部运作）

---

(39) [13:06-13:27] **This is another key feature actually to um a silicon brain rather than a carbon based brain. Um our carbon based brains it's really hard to measure the embeddings. It's really hard to know exactly what somebody is thinking. etc. But with these silicon brains, you actually if you form them the right way and this is what Neuroplex is about.**

这实际上是硅基大脑相对于碳基大脑的另一个关键特性。我们的碳基大脑，真的很难测量嵌入向量，很难确切知道某人在想什么。但对于这些硅基大脑，如果你以正确的方式构建它们——这正是 **Neuroplex** 要做的——

解析：
* **silicon brain**：硅基大脑（AI 系统）🔥
* **carbon based brain**：碳基大脑（人脑）
* **measure the embeddings**：测量嵌入向量

---

(40) [13:25-13:48] **And we have a white paper out there so you can um look at that. But uh if you form them the right way, they then you can actually inspect like what is that brain thinking? Um what did it think it heard? Um what does it think its next move should be? And then this also gives you an opportunity to put guardrails in to say whoa whoa whoa, you know, maybe don't do that.**

我们有一篇白皮书，你可以去看看。如果你以正确的方式构建它们，你就可以真正检查这个大脑在想什么，它认为它听到了什么，它认为下一步应该做什么。这也给了你添加护栏的机会，说"哇哇哇，也许别这样做"。

解析：
* **white paper**：白皮书（技术文档）🔥
* **inspect**：动词，检查、审视
* **next move**：下一步行动
* **put guardrails in**：添加护栏

(41) [13:48-14:10] **Yeah. So um but also you know are opening up that new type of framework or architecture there will be challenges with it too um and I think people see this in speech to speech models now. I'm basically I'm just describing a speech to speech model I'm describing a different way to build a speech to speech model but uh the current speech to speech models are black boxes you can't control them as much etc.**

是的。当然，开放这种新型框架或架构也会有挑战。我认为人们在现在的语音对语音模型中看到了这一点。我基本上就是在描述一个语音对语音模型，只是描述了一种不同的构建方式。但目前的语音对语音模型是黑盒，你无法很好地控制它们。

解析：
* **speech to speech model**：语音对语音模型 🔥
* **open up**：开放、开启
* **black box**：黑盒

---

(42) [14:10-14:31] **And so if you look at B2B adoption of um of the real-time speech to speech models that are out there they're uh it it's typically really low um because they it can't it can't control it as well, can't debug it as well. Um it can't guardrail it as well. Also, just reliability is typically worse. Latency is worse, you know, all these things.**

所以如果你看看市面上实时语音对语音模型的 B2B 采用率，通常非常低。因为无法很好地控制它，无法很好地调试它，无法很好地添加护栏。而且可靠性通常更差，延迟也更差，所有这些问题。

解析：
* **B2B adoption**：企业对企业采用率 🔥
* **debug** /diːˈbʌɡ/：动词，调试
* **reliability**：名词，可靠性

---

(43) [14:31-14:56] **Um but the uh Neuroplex architecture is addressing all these at once. Um but this is a big research project at Deepgram. So it's uh it means more people, more compute, more data, uh more testing with um uh you know with partners and customers. Um and our product team loves uh talking with folks about this.**

但 **Neuroplex** 架构正在一次性解决所有这些问题。但这是 **Deepgram** 的一个大型研究项目。所以这意味着需要更多的人、更多的算力、更多的数据、更多与合作伙伴和客户的测试。我们的产品团队很喜欢和大家讨论这个话题。

解析：
* **address**：动词，解决（问题）
* **at once**：一次性、同时
* **research project**：研究项目

---

(44) [14:53-15:20] **Um uh actually another part of our raise is uh starting a uh a collaboration hub learning center in San Francisco. So it'll be uh downtown right near Salesforce Park. We want to invite our partners, customers, anybody curious about voice to go there, look at talks, look at the next generation of voice, um, and see like some before it's released demos of Neuroplex and that type of thing where our researchers and engineers are showing off what they're working on. Um, so I'm excited about that.**

实际上，这次融资的另一部分是在旧金山启动一个协作中心学习中心。它会在市中心，就在 **Salesforce Park** 附近。我们想邀请我们的合作伙伴、客户、任何对语音感兴趣的人来那里，看演讲，看下一代语音技术，看一些 **Neuroplex** 发布前的演示，我们的研究人员和工程师会展示他们正在做的东西。我对此很兴奋。

解析：
* **collaboration hub**：协作中心 🔥
* **learning center**：学习中心
* **before it's released**：发布前的
* **show off**：展示

---

(45) [15:20-15:43] **That's awesome. Yeah. And I'm especially excited because I think even short term like long-term like this vision of Neuroplex, but I think even how that manifests into systems today is very similar to how autonomy and self-driving was able to get ahead is by having these models that are able to talk to each other and having this comm's layer where you can hear a siren and then also see like what's happening around me via LIDAR, via cameras.**

太棒了。我特别兴奋，因为不管是短期还是长期的 **Neuroplex** 愿景，我认为它在今天系统中的体现方式，非常类似于自动驾驶能够取得领先的方式——通过让这些模型能够相互通信，有一个通信层，你可以听到警笛，同时通过激光雷达、摄像头看到周围发生的事情。

解析：
* **manifest into**：体现为、表现为 🔥
* **autonomy**：名词，自主性
* **self-driving**：自动驾驶
* **comm's layer**：通信层（communication layer）
* **LIDAR**：激光雷达

---

(46) [15:43-15:57] **And have all of these sensory inputs to then make decisions around what do I think this person is going to do next or where should the car go next? And I think that's really what we need in voice AI is to have that next level of autonomy.**

拥有所有这些感官输入，然后做出决策：这个人下一步会做什么？车应该往哪里走？我认为这正是语音 AI 需要的——拥有下一个层次的自主性。

解析：
* **sensory inputs**：感官输入 🔥
* **make decisions around**：围绕...做决策
* **next level of**：下一个层次的

---

(47) [15:57-16:17] **You need to have parallel systems because you don't when you're a human walking through the world, you don't take one step forward and say, "Okay, let me reassess what I'm going to do next. Now, I'm going to take another step forward." And the same is true as you're speaking. I'm constantly thinking about what I'm going to say next.**

你需要有并行系统。因为当你作为人类行走在世界上时，你不会走一步然后说"好，让我重新评估一下下一步要做什么，现在我再走一步"。说话也是一样。我一直在想接下来要说什么。

解析：
* **parallel systems**：并行系统 🔥
* **reassess** /ˌriːəˈses/：动词，重新评估
* **constantly**：副词，不断地

---

(48) [16:10-16:31] **Thinking about like lots of background ideas, kind of also at the same time listening to what you're saying. And so I think I'm really excited about this vision from at least as a nerd in self-driving that this is definitely like a direction that I'm really bullish on bringing us just like that next leap forward, not just incrementally forward.**

同时思考很多背景想法，也在同时听你在说什么。作为一个自动驾驶领域的技术宅，我对这个愿景真的很兴奋。我非常看好这个方向能带给我们下一个飞跃，而不只是渐进式前进。

解析：
* **background ideas**：背景想法
* **nerd**：名词，技术宅、极客
* **bullish on**：看好、看涨 🔥
* **leap forward**：飞跃
* **incrementally**：副词，渐进地

---

(49) [16:31-17:00] **Yeah. And yeah, it's we can just look at robotics systems and how they progressed and how they had to work in the real world and how they had the different levels and uh you don't have to reinvent the wheel here uh in order to in order to predict the future of what's going to happen in voice AI. Um uh you just look at the different systems in those different levels and try to build in the redundancy.**

是的。我们可以看看机器人系统是如何发展的，它们如何在现实世界中工作，如何有不同的层级。你不需要重新发明轮子来预测语音 AI 的未来会发生什么。只需要看看这些不同层级中的不同系统，尝试构建冗余性。

解析：
* **robotics systems**：机器人系统
* **reinvent the wheel**：重新发明轮子（做不必要的重复工作）🔥
* **redundancy** /rɪˈdʌndənsi/：名词，冗余性

---

(50) [16:57-17:21] **And they're fairly common architectures to do that. Um so yeah um but I'll tell you like building in voice AI right now um and just in AI in general but you know from a frontier perspective there are so many like stones to flip over and look under um and there's the prevalent um story is just go just go bigger build bigger more data more more more uh more GPUs more data um larger models more memory etc.**

这些都是相当常见的架构。但我告诉你，现在在语音 AI 领域构建，从前沿角度来说，有太多石头可以翻开去探索。而主流叙事就是"做大、建更大、更多数据、更多 GPU、更大模型、更多内存"等等。

解析：
* **fairly common**：相当常见
* **stones to flip over**：可以翻开探索的石头（比喻待发现的机会）🔥
* **prevalent** /ˈprevələnt/：形容词，流行的、主流的
* **GPUs**：图形处理器

---

(51) [17:34-18:05] **Um, and that's kind of a band-aid. Uh, like it does get you advances, but like your expenses are compounding like with n squared. It's not an efficient way to go about solving the problem. Um, and when you build the system in this other way where you have a few compartmentalized smart pieces of design in there to handle different planning tasks and that type of thing, then you just took your compute load that you needed and maybe divided by 100.**

那有点像创可贴。它确实能让你进步，但你的开支是以 n 的平方在复合增长。这不是解决问题的高效方式。当你用另一种方式构建系统——用几个模块化的智能设计来处理不同的规划任务——你就可以把所需的算力负载除以 100。

解析：
* **band-aid**：创可贴（比喻临时解决方案）🔥
* **n squared**：n 的平方
* **compartmentalized**：形容词，模块化的、分隔的 🔥
* **compute load**：算力负载

---

(52) [18:05-18:38] **Um and it's yeah it this is how things will advance and actually it's an interesting thing I think it's tempting for folks to think yeah but compute will get so cheap that it won't matter. And I don't know maybe 20 years from now 10 years from now something like that. But there's an assumed equivalence that isn't real here because if you reduce your compute needed in order to do a task, now you can use smarter components. Um so it always wins to have the componentized approach as long as it's as expressive as the mega model.**

这就是事情将如何发展。有趣的是，人们很容易想"但是算力会变得很便宜，这就不重要了"。也许 10 年 20 年后吧。但这里有一个假设的等价性其实不成立：如果你减少完成任务所需的算力，你就可以使用更智能的组件。所以只要模块化方法和大模型一样具有表达力，它就总是更胜一筹。

解析：
* **tempting**：形容词，诱人的、令人想要的
* **assumed equivalence**：假设的等价性
* **componentized approach**：模块化方法 🔥
* **expressive**：形容词，具有表达力的
* **mega model**：超大模型

---

(53) [18:38-19:01] **Um so yeah but it's just more complex to have the like sort of component view of the world. Um how do you get them all to work together? Yeah, totally. And heuristics can also take you so far as well as like getting more determinism and more like controllability of those models.**

是的，但拥有这种模块化的世界观更复杂。你如何让它们全部协同工作？完全同意。启发式方法也能带你走很远，还能获得更多确定性和对这些模型更多的可控性。

解析：
* **component view**：模块化视角
* **work together**：协同工作
* **heuristics** /hjuːˈrɪstɪks/：名词，启发式方法 🔥
* **determinism**：名词，确定性
* **controllability**：名词，可控性

---

(54) [19:10-19:38] **Yeah. It's an interesting bet like you can put a lot of money and put it in one area and you'll get amazing artifacts that come out of it and they will be useful. Um but after a while you're like wait a minute this has to be deployed at scale in billions of conversations you know multiple times per day and like how just how much are we wasting how much are we destroying the environment etc if we do it that way.**

是的，这是一个有趣的赌注。你可以在一个领域投入大量资金，会得到惊人的成果，它们也会有用。但过一段时间你会想：等等，这必须大规模部署在数十亿次对话中，每天多次。如果我们这样做，我们浪费了多少，破坏了多少环境？

解析：
* **bet**：名词，赌注、押注
* **artifacts**：名词，产物、成果 🔥
* **deployed at scale**：大规模部署
* **destroy the environment**：破坏环境

---

(55) [19:35-20:00] **And that's something we think about all the time and also just you know you can see the sort of eye watering numbers that most frontier AI companies are putting up where they're saying hey look at my ARR yes it's big but then look at how much I burned and it's like a hundred times more and it's like whoa these I can see why people are worried about a bubble if that's what companies are talking about.**

这是我们一直在思考的事情。你也可以看到大多数前沿 AI 公司公布的那些令人瞠目的数字——他们说"看看我的 ARR，是的很大"，但再看看他们烧了多少钱，是 ARR 的一百倍。难怪人们担心泡沫，如果这就是公司们在谈论的东西。

解析：
* **eye watering**：令人瞠目的、惊人的 🔥
* **ARR**：年度经常性收入（Annual Recurring Revenue）🔥
* **burn**：动词，烧钱
* **bubble**：名词，泡沫（经济术语）

---

(56) [20:00-20:12] **Totally cool. Well, Scott, congratulations again. I'm super excited for everything that Deepgram has in store. So, uh yeah, congratulations on the big day. Yeah, thank you so much.**

太酷了。**Scott**，再次祝贺你。我对 **Deepgram** 的一切计划都超级兴奋。恭喜你们这个大日子。非常感谢。

解析：
* **have in store**：计划中、即将到来 🔥
* **the big day**：大日子
