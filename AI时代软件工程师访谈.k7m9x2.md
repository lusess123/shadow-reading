(1) [15:08-15:27] **So, I need to put that on there, right? But I bias strongly toward figuring out things you want that are hard to change. So many companies they'll do like a coding interview and then we'll do a design interview. And I feel like most of those things honestly can be easily taught like for a reasonably sharp person. I feel like the things that cannot be changed are very difficult to change but you actually want in a person.**

所以我需要把这个放上去，对吧？但我更倾向于去考察那些你真正想要的、且很难改变的特质。很多公司会做编程面试，然后做设计面试。但老实说，我觉得这些东西对于一个足够聪明的人来说都是可以轻松学会的。我觉得那些无法改变的东西才是真正难以改变的，但那恰恰是你真正想在一个人身上看到的。

解析：
* **bias toward** 🔥：短语，倾向于、偏向于
* **figure out**：短语，弄清楚、搞明白
* **reasonably sharp**：短语，相当聪明的（sharp 在这里是"聪明的"意思）

(2) [15:27-15:47] **One is self-starting right an initiative and a drive to do things on their own. A ability to receive feedback and to really be insightful about themselves. That's a thing that many people struggle with. And if you don't have that, you're not going to build that in someone, right? For sure. Third is a bent toward collaborative working, right?**

第一个是自驱力，也就是主动性和自己做事的动力。第二个是接受反馈的能力，以及对自己有深刻洞察的能力。这是很多人都很挣扎的事情。如果你没有这个能力，你是没办法在别人身上培养出来的，对吧？确实如此。第三个是倾向于协作的工作方式。

解析：
* **self-starting**：形容词，自我驱动的、主动的
* **initiative** /ɪˈnɪʃətɪv/：名词，主动性、进取心
* **insightful**：形容词，有洞察力的
* **struggle with**：短语，与...作斗争、在...方面有困难
* **a bent toward** 🔥：短语，对...的倾向（bent 作名词表示"倾向"）

---

(3) [15:47-16:16] **Like a lot of people especially the stronger they are as an individual, the easier it is for them to be the lone frontiersmen on the western front like defending their own territory, right? But it becomes harder to find people that truly make groups better when they're in there. They don't want to work with others at that point. Exactly. So, you end up like I end up looking for those characteristics a lot more than like can you code this thing? Can you design this thing which I feel like for most smart people are easily teachable.**

就像很多人，尤其是个人能力越强的人，就越容易成为那种在西部边疆独自守卫自己领地的孤独拓荒者，对吧？但是要找到那种真正能让团队变得更好的人就变得更难了。到了那个程度他们就不想和别人合作了。没错。所以最后我会更多地去寻找这些特质，而不是看你能不能写这段代码、能不能设计这个东西——我觉得对大多数聪明人来说，这些都是很容易教会的。

解析：
* **the stronger... the easier**：语法，the + 比较级... the + 比较级（越...越...）
* **lone frontiersmen**：短语，孤独的拓荒者（frontier 边疆）
* **end up doing**：短语，最终做某事
* **teachable**：形容词，可教的、可培养的

(4) [16:16-16:45] **What are things that current people who want to make it into software engineering should focus on? Yeah. Current day, I feel it's really tough with AI coming on, right? The thing that I tell people a lot is, you know, AI is not going to put everybody out of a job, but it might put, you know, 30% of people out of a job, right? Well, I think over time higher than that, but the percentage is not all or none suddenly. It's not like one day you wake up and there are no software developers.**

现在想进入软件工程领域的人应该关注什么？说实话，我觉得在 AI 时代这真的很难，对吧？我经常跟人说的是，AI 不会让所有人失业，但它可能会让 30% 的人失业，对吧？嗯，我觉得随着时间推移会更高，但这个比例不会是突然从无到有或从有到无。不会说某天你醒来发现已经没有软件开发者了。

解析：
* **make it into**：短语，成功进入（某领域）
* **put... out of a job** 🔥：短语，使...失业
* **coming on**：短语，正在到来、正在发生
* **all or none**：短语，全有或全无

---

(5) [16:45-17:09] **But I do think the tide is rising quickly. Winter is coming and you will survive if you are always in the top fraction of people, right? So, nobody will go to zero on all the hiring. People tend to want to keep the best people. I would say even if you consistently try to be above average, just the top 50% that should keep you safe for a long time.**

但我确实认为潮水正在快速上涨。凛冬将至，而你只有始终处于顶尖的那部分人群中才能生存下来，对吧？所以不会有人完全停止招聘。人们总是倾向于留住最好的人。我想说的是，即使你只是持续努力保持在平均水平之上，只要在前 50%，那应该能让你安全很长时间。

解析：
* **the tide is rising** 🔥：习语，潮水正在上涨（比喻形势在变化）
* **Winter is coming**：《权力的游戏》名言，意为"严峻的考验即将到来"
* **top fraction**：短语，顶尖的一部分
* **consistently**：副词，持续地、一贯地
* **above average**：短语，高于平均水平

---

(6) [17:09-17:38] **And what are those defining characteristics that people can work on? Yeah. Well, I would say if you even just work harder than the average person, right? Many people just want to work the minimum amount that they can get paid their salary for these slow quitting people or whatever quitting. Yeah. Like there are many people that think it's this huge life hack to like be undiscovered like laziness, right? Like you're just outsourcing all your work. If you just work hard, you're already going to be way ahead of most people.**

那些人们可以努力培养的关键特质是什么？嗯，我会说即使你只是比普通人更努力一点就行，对吧？很多人只想做最少的工作量来拿工资，就是那些"安静离职"的人。是的。就像很多人觉得让自己的懒惰不被发现是一个巨大的人生秘诀，对吧？你只是把所有工作外包出去。如果你只是努力工作，你就已经远远领先于大多数人了。

解析：
* **defining characteristics**：短语，关键特质、决定性特征
* **slow quitting / quiet quitting** 🔥：短语，安静离职（指消极怠工但不辞职）
* **life hack**：短语，生活窍门、人生秘诀
* **outsource**：动词，外包
* **way ahead of**：短语，远远领先于

---

(7) [17:38-18:09] **But the other thing is don't strap yourself to things that are obviously disappearing. What's obvious? Like I would say my personal opinion right now is if you choose to join a company that refuses to let you use AI as part of the day's coding, you are joining a thing that is going to be an outmoded business soon. Like I right now would refuse to join a company that would not let me use the latest technology that I can use to produce the code. So that's a good example where you just don't want to strap yourself to sinking ships either.**

但另一件事是不要把自己绑在那些明显正在消失的东西上。什么是明显的？我个人的看法是，如果你选择加入一家拒绝让你在日常编码中使用 AI 的公司，你就是在加入一个很快就会过时的企业。比如我现在会拒绝加入一家不让我使用最新技术来写代码的公司。这就是一个很好的例子——你不要把自己绑在正在下沉的船上。

解析：
* **strap yourself to** 🔥：短语，把自己绑在...上
* **outmoded** /aʊtˈmoʊdɪd/：形容词，过时的、老式的
* **sinking ship**：短语，正在下沉的船（比喻注定失败的事业）

---

(8) [18:09-18:26] **Yeah. And I guess part of that is potentially hopping companies, exploring what's latest in the trends and all that. Yeah, you have to be insightful about whether your company is one of these sinking ships, right? And if it is, you should find a way out. I got to ask, are computer science majors cooked? Is AI taking over?**

是的。我猜这其中一部分就是可能要跳槽、探索最新的趋势等等。是的，你必须对你的公司是否是这些正在下沉的船之一有洞察力，对吧？如果是的话，你应该找到出路。我得问一下，计算机专业的人是不是完蛋了？AI 正在接管一切吗？

解析：
* **hopping companies**：短语，跳槽（hop 本意是"跳"）
* **cooked** 🔥：俚语，完蛋了、凉了（网络流行语）
* **take over**：短语，接管、控制

---

(9) [18:26-18:51] **Well, I think in the long run, it feels like yes. Now, the question is how long? [laughter] Okay, the question is how? Elaborate. You just a lot of people. So there are many people that will say to you things like well we thought the ATM would replace bank tellers but now we have more bank tellers than we ever did right. So that is the majority opinion. I think it will displace most jobs that can be done systematically.**

嗯，我觉得从长远来看，感觉是的。现在问题是多长时间？[笑] 好的，问题是怎么会这样？详细说说。很多人会跟你说这样的话：我们曾经以为 ATM 会取代银行柜员，但现在我们的银行柜员比以前更多了，对吧。这是主流观点。我认为 AI 会取代大多数可以系统化完成的工作。

解析：
* **in the long run** 🔥：短语，从长远来看
* **elaborate**：动词，详细说明、阐述
* **ATM** (Automated Teller Machine)：自动取款机
* **bank teller**：名词，银行柜员
* **displace**：动词，取代、置换
* **systematically**：副词，系统地、有条理地

---

(10) [18:51-19:21] **And the thing with software is that the best software is built systematically. Right? It's and the semantics of coding languages are well defined. And so it's unlike asking software to write the great American novel, right? where the semantics aren't as strongly defined. So I do think it's a structured job. You take a job like paralegals, right, who might have the biggest thing they might do on a weekend is read 5,000 pages and summarize, right? This is something that AI is perfect at, right? So are we still going to have those jobs? Almost definitely not.**

而软件的问题在于，最好的软件是系统化构建的，对吧？而且编程语言的语义是有明确定义的。所以这不像让软件去写伟大的美国小说，对吧？小说的语义没有那么严格定义。所以我确实认为这是一份结构化的工作。就像律师助理这份工作，他们周末可能做的最大的事情就是阅读 5000 页文档然后做总结，对吧？这是 AI 非常擅长的事情，对吧？所以我们还会有这些工作吗？几乎肯定不会了。

解析：
* **semantics** /sɪˈmæntɪks/：名词，语义学、语义
* **well defined**：短语，定义明确的
* **the great American novel**：短语，伟大的美国小说（文学概念）
* **paralegal** /ˌpærəˈliːɡl/：名词，律师助理
* **almost definitely**：短语，几乎肯定

---

(11) [19:21-19:53] **Right? So I do think software falls somewhere in that bucket of like it will probably replace most software developers. But then the question of how fast this is really hard to say, right? There are many people that say like, oh, it's easy to get to 80%, but it's hard to go from 80 to 90 and 90 to 100. And that may well be happening here as well. And so then I have to ask you, are there more roles that you think will emerge as a result of AI that potentially software engineers can go into?**

对吧？所以我确实认为软件行业属于这类——它可能会取代大多数软件开发者。但问题是这个过程会有多快，这真的很难说，对吧？很多人说，达到 80% 很容易，但从 80% 到 90%、从 90% 到 100% 就很难了。这里可能也是这种情况。所以我得问你，你觉得会不会有更多新角色因为 AI 而出现，是软件工程师可以转型进入的？

解析：
* **fall in/into that bucket**：短语，属于那一类
* **how fast**：疑问词组，多快
* **may well be**：短语，很可能是
* **emerge**：动词，出现、涌现
* **as a result of**：短语，由于、作为...的结果

---

(12) [19:53-20:16] **Yeah. So if you consider, for instance, tech meetups, right? One of the things that annoyed me most about tech meetups is a lot of them you'll go to, it's always I'm a CEO that's looking for a CTO, right? This is very classic. I have this brilliant idea. I'm looking for a CTO, right? That sort of person now is super empowered, right? They no longer need a technical person. They can probably vibe code their first prototype to at least have a proof of concept work. So just the one man CEO can...**

是的。比如说，你想想技术聚会，对吧？技术聚会最让我烦的一件事是，很多聚会你去了会发现，总是有人说"我是 CEO，在找 CTO"，对吧？这太经典了。"我有这个绝妙的想法，我在找一个 CTO"，对吧？这类人现在被大大赋能了，对吧？他们不再需要技术人员了。他们可能可以通过 **vibe coding** 写出第一个原型，至少让概念验证跑起来。所以单打独斗的 CEO 就能...

解析：
* **tech meetup**：短语，技术聚会、技术交流会
* **CTO** (Chief Technology Officer)：首席技术官
* **empowered**：形容词，被赋能的、有能力的
* **vibe code** 🔥：动词，氛围编程（指用 AI 辅助、跟着感觉写代码的新方式）
* **proof of concept**：短语，概念验证（缩写 PoC）

---

(13) [20:16-20:47] **Yes. So I think it democratizes as you said that as well is the accessibility of building custom software. Like the beauty with a computer is that it is a universal tool. If you can express to it what you want done, it can do it. So this is a generic power, a superpower that technical people have that soon everybody will have. And that I think overall is a great thing. I think software engineers that really love that work, I think there will always be some aspect because someone's got to design the next version, right? So like there's always going to be a small subset of people working on that.**

是的。所以我认为它像你说的那样实现了民主化，也就是构建定制软件的门槛降低了。计算机的美妙之处在于它是一个通用工具。如果你能向它表达你想做什么，它就能做到。所以这是一种通用能力，一种技术人员拥有的超能力，很快每个人都会拥有。我认为总体来说这是一件好事。我觉得那些真正热爱这份工作的软件工程师，总会有一席之地，因为总得有人来设计下一个版本，对吧？所以总会有一小部分人在做这件事。

解析：
* **democratize** /dɪˈmɑːkrətaɪz/ 🔥：动词，使民主化、使大众化
* **accessibility**：名词，可及性、可获得性
* **universal tool**：短语，通用工具
* **generic**：形容词，通用的、一般的
* **subset**：名词，子集、一小部分

---

(14) [20:47-21:15] **But I think most software developers will need to go into domains where their technical expertise is not at producing the code itself. Maybe you're great at software architecture. Maybe you have a brilliant idea for a new game mechanic you want for your mobile game, right? Like those are the types of domains that I think you have to go into. You can't just remain you will not sit there like competing with this thing in code generation. Like it's hard for me to believe that that will be your specialty that you'll beat it at.**

但我认为大多数软件开发者需要进入那些技术专长不在于生产代码本身的领域。也许你擅长软件架构。也许你对手机游戏的新游戏机制有绝妙的想法，对吧？这些才是我认为你必须进入的领域类型。你不能就这样待着，不会坐在那里跟这个东西在代码生成上竞争。我很难相信代码生成会成为你能打败它的专长。

解析：
* **domain**：名词，领域、范畴
* **expertise** /ˌekspɜːrˈtiːz/：名词，专业知识、专长
* **software architecture**：短语，软件架构
* **game mechanic**：短语，游戏机制
* **specialty**：名词，专长、特长

---

(15) [21:15-21:38] **Okay. So, we're going to become architects and the AI is going to be the code generation. I mean, eventually, won't the AI be able to architect it? They'll identify the problems, architect the solution, code a solution. Yeah. I mean, this is the opinion that I have that most of my friends don't agree with me on is I feel like as the level of IQ of AI goes up, at some point it will displace so many jobs that it will become difficult for the average human to do something that capitalism would compensate them for.**

好的。所以我们将成为架构师，而 AI 将负责代码生成。我的意思是，最终 AI 难道不会也能做架构吗？它们会识别问题、设计解决方案、编写解决方案。是的。我的意思是，这是我持有的一个观点，我大多数朋友都不同意——我觉得随着 AI 智商水平的提升，在某个时刻它会取代如此多的工作，以至于普通人很难做到能让资本主义给他们报酬的事情。

解析：
* **architect**：动词，设计、构建（这里当动词用）
* **IQ of AI**：短语，AI 的智商水平
* **displace**：动词，取代
* **capitalism** /ˈkæpɪtəlɪzəm/：名词，资本主义
* **compensate**：动词，补偿、支付报酬

---

(16) [21:38-22:09] **Like you need to add value in some way that people are willing to buy your service, right? And I think as AI gets smarter and smarter, people are going to have to invent new ways to add that sort of value. We used to think with the Jetsons, right, that the robots would clean our houses while we did art and music, right? And it turned out that we are cleaning our own houses because the Roomba still can't vacuum worth anything, right? But the robots are taking the music jobs. They're taking the art jobs. They're doing these crazy videos like, right, all of the stuff we thought we would have free time to go do because Rosie was vacuuming the house is not happening.**

就是说你需要以某种方式增加价值，让人们愿意购买你的服务，对吧？我认为随着 AI 变得越来越聪明，人们将不得不发明新的方式来增加这种价值。我们曾经以为像《杰森一家》里那样，机器人会打扫我们的房子，而我们去做艺术和音乐，对吧？结果是我们在打扫自己的房子，因为 **Roomba** 扫地机器人根本扫不干净，对吧？但机器人正在抢走音乐工作、艺术工作。它们在制作那些疯狂的视频，对吧，所有我们以为会有空闲时间去做的事情——因为 **Rosie** 在吸尘——都没有发生。

解析：
* **add value**：短语，增加价值
* **the Jetsons**：《杰森一家》，1960年代的美国动画片，描绘未来生活
* **Roomba**：品牌名，iRobot 公司的扫地机器人
* **worth anything**：短语，值得一提的、像样的（否定句中表示"根本不行"）
* **Rosie**：《杰森一家》中的机器人女仆名字

---

(17) [22:09-22:33] **It's going the other way, right? And so I do think that the tide is rising in a way that at some point most human jobs that require intellect, you won't be able to beat a computer price-wise or speed-wise. Okay. When AI will take over software engineering. Yeah, Bill Gates is famous for saying something to the effect of we always overestimate how quickly technology will revolutionize things in the next few years and we always underestimate how much it will in 10 years.**

事情正在往相反的方向发展，对吧？所以我确实认为潮水正在以这样一种方式上涨——在某个时刻，大多数需要智力的人类工作，你在价格上或速度上都无法击败计算机。好的。那 AI 什么时候会接管软件工程呢？是的，**Bill Gates** 有句名言大意是：我们总是高估技术在未来几年内革新事物的速度，而总是低估它在 10 年内的影响。

解析：
* **the other way**：短语，相反的方向
* **intellect** /ˈɪntəlekt/：名词，智力、才智
* **price-wise / speed-wise**：副词，在价格方面/在速度方面（-wise 后缀表示"在...方面"）
* **to the effect of** 🔥：短语，大意是、意思是
* **revolutionize**：动词，彻底改变、革新
* **underestimate**：动词，低估

---

(18) [22:39-23:12] **I think that'll happen here is most people are calling shots like by 2026 it will be like ASI and it's going to launch nuclear war and all this stuff, right? I think that honestly is probably a little bit too optimistic, but I think in the 10-year time frame, will it radically reshape what it means to be a worker in society? I think it will. Okay. So, by 2035, our world's going to look very different. I have no idea what the timeline is, right? Because a lot of other things can go nonlinear, right?**

我觉得这种情况会发生——大多数人都在预测说到 2026 年就会出现 **ASI**（通用超级智能），然后它会发动核战争之类的，对吧？我觉得老实说这可能有点过于乐观了，但我认为在 10 年的时间框架内，它会从根本上重塑作为社会中一个工人意味着什么吗？我认为会的。好的。所以到 2035 年，我们的世界将看起来非常不同。我不知道具体时间线是什么，对吧？因为很多其他事情可能会变得非线性，对吧？

解析：
* **call shots** 🔥：短语，做预测、做决定
* **ASI** (Artificial Super Intelligence)：通用超级智能
* **radically**：副词，根本地、彻底地
* **reshape**：动词，重塑、改造
* **time frame**：短语，时间框架
* **nonlinear**：形容词，非线性的（指发展不是渐进的，可能突然加速）

---

(19) [23:12-23:50] **Once the code starts modifying itself, things can go like second order very quickly and things get weird. So, I definitely don't want to make random predictions, but my intuition is that we are overenthused about some things that it can do, right? But in the long run, we're too pessimistic about how quickly exponentials work. True. And then I got to ask you, if we have a lot of computer science students, software engineering enthusiasts, should they not pursue that degree anymore or what should they do to adapt? Yeah, great question. What else should they do?**

一旦代码开始自我修改，事情可能会非常快地进入二阶效应，然后一切都会变得很奇怪。所以我绝对不想做随机预测，但我的直觉是，我们对它能做的一些事情过于热情了，对吧？但从长远来看，我们对指数增长的速度又过于悲观了。确实。那我得问你，如果我们有很多计算机专业的学生、软件工程爱好者，他们应该不再追求这个学位了吗？还是他们应该怎么适应？是的，好问题。他们还能做什么呢？

解析：
* **second order**：短语，二阶的（指变化的变化，加速效应）
* **overenthused**：形容词，过度热情的
* **exponential** /ˌekspəˈnenʃl/：形容词/名词，指数的/指数增长
* **pursue**：动词，追求、从事
* **adapt**：动词，适应

---

(20) [23:50-24:26] **Yeah. Right. Like cuz right now people are saying the obvious thing which is like oh you should go into plumbing because like plumbing you know that's physical and it's services blah blah blah. How long do you think a plumber is going to have their job? You know what I mean? Like if you look at where the optimist is going where AI training can often you now have robots that can catch like crazy balloon balls or whatever, right? That is obviously increasing and improving at the same pace, right? And so my question is like you can't just call this one job of software development and say like oh they're cooked we're going to have to go to you know you're going to have to become a fast order cook right...**

对，是的。因为现在人们在说那些显而易见的事情，比如"你应该去做水管工，因为水管工是体力活、是服务业"等等。你觉得水管工的工作能保住多久？你明白我的意思吗？比如如果你看看乐观主义者的方向，AI 训练常常让机器人能接住那些疯狂的气球之类的东西，对吧？这显然也在以同样的速度增长和改进，对吧？所以我的问题是，你不能只针对软件开发这一份工作说"哦他们完蛋了，你得去做快餐厨师"，对吧...

解析：
* **plumbing** /ˈplʌmɪŋ/：名词，水管工工作、管道系统
* **plumber**：名词，水管工
* **blah blah blah**：拟声词，等等等等（表示省略）
* **cooked**：俚语，完蛋了
* **fast order cook**：短语，快餐厨师

---

(21) [24:26-24:55] **...because I have a hard time imagining what other jobs you know get done. I feel like the bigger thing we need to do is make sure that our society's rules that legislatively that we are anticipating this future and that we aren't going to leave a bunch of people with an inability to make work for themselves. Yeah. But I mean that's I guess one side of it. The government needs to intercept and ensure people have food on the table. But if you were a student right now, what would you focus on?**

...因为我很难想象还有什么其他工作能幸存。我觉得我们需要做的更大的事情是确保我们社会的规则——从立法层面——预见到这个未来，并且不会让一大批人陷入无法养活自己的境地。是的。但我的意思是，这只是其中一方面。政府需要介入并确保人们有饭吃。但如果你现在是一个学生，你会关注什么？

解析：
* **have a hard time doing**：短语，很难做某事
* **legislatively** /ˈledʒɪsleɪtɪvli/：副词，在立法上
* **anticipate**：动词，预见、预期
* **intercept**：动词，介入、拦截
* **have food on the table**：短语，有饭吃、能养活自己

---

(22) [24:55-25:30] **Yeah, it depends how good of a computer scientist I am. Both good relative to my peers as well as how much do I have a natural passion for it? Yeah. Right. I would never counsel a person to become a professional pianist. Yeah. Even though a very small number of people do make it as a professional, right? And those people have the passion for it and they're willing to work 12 hours a day at piano to do it, right? If you're that sort of computer scientist, you should absolutely stay in computer science because you will love it, right? If you're the type of person that doesn't need to be paid and you're still writing code, you should still do it because the robot might code faster than you, but you love writing the code. So, just do the thing. You're like an artist that paints, right?**

这取决于我作为计算机科学家有多优秀。既要看相对于同龄人有多好，也要看我对它有多少天然的热情，对吧？我永远不会建议一个人去成为职业钢琴家。是的。尽管确实有极少数人能成为职业钢琴家，对吧？而那些人对此有热情，他们愿意每天练 12 小时钢琴，对吧？如果你是那种类型的计算机科学家，你绝对应该留在计算机领域，因为你会热爱它，对吧？如果你是那种不需要被支付报酬仍然在写代码的人，你应该继续做，因为机器人可能比你写代码更快，但你热爱写代码。所以就去做吧。你就像一个画画的艺术家，对吧？

解析：
* **relative to**：短语，相对于
* **counsel**：动词，建议、劝告
* **make it**：短语，成功
* **passion for**：短语，对...的热情

---

(23) [25:30-26:00] **Yeah. I think if you're the type of person that was a business major, but you went into computer science cuz you saw all the dollar signs, you should get out cuz a person with a passion is going to out compete you. And if you didn't have the natural propensity toward it, you're never going to be as good as someone who sees the tide rising and is outrunning you, right? So I think that it depends a lot on your personal commitment, your personal passion, and an objective look at how you do relative to your peers.**

是的。我觉得如果你是那种本来是商科专业，但因为看到了钱的诱惑而转到计算机领域的人，你应该退出，因为有热情的人会胜过你。如果你没有对它的天然倾向，你永远不会比那些看到潮水上涨并且正在跑赢你的人更优秀，对吧？所以我认为这很大程度上取决于你的个人投入、你的个人热情，以及对你相对于同龄人表现如何的客观审视。

解析：
* **dollar signs**：短语，金钱符号（比喻金钱的诱惑）
* **out compete** 🔥：动词，胜过、在竞争中击败
* **propensity** /prəˈpensəti/：名词，倾向、习性
* **outrun**：动词，跑赢、超过
* **commitment**：名词，投入、承诺

---

(24) [26:00-26:45] **For sure. For sure. I think the passion and natural curiosity will drive so much more innovation and education. Yes. The passion of dollar signs. Yeah. And if you take a look at America, one of the many reasons we're a great country, right, is that in America, you can host the world's largest ball of twine, you know, which is somewhere in middle America, right? And you can make a living just running a museum shop that does that, right? This is the beauty of America, right? is like if you have a passion for something, you could definitely make a living doing it. You just got to be sure that you love twine more than anybody else, right? You're willing to do the twine, right? So, I think that the most important thing is be excellent at the thing you choose to do and outexecute other people in that domain. In America, you'll always have a job based on that.**

确实。确实。我认为热情和天然的好奇心会驱动更多的创新和教育。是的。对金钱的"热情"。是的。如果你看看美国，我们是一个伟大国家的众多原因之一是，在美国，你可以展示世界上最大的麻绳球，你知道的，就在美国中部某个地方，对吧？你可以靠经营一家这样的博物馆商店来谋生，对吧？这就是美国的美妙之处，对吧？就是如果你对某件事有热情，你绝对可以靠它谋生。你只需要确保你比任何人都更爱麻绳，对吧？你愿意做麻绳这件事，对吧？所以我认为最重要的是在你选择做的事情上做到卓越，并且在那个领域执行力超过其他人。在美国，基于这一点你总会有一份工作。

解析：
* **ball of twine**：短语，麻绳球（美国有个著名的"世界最大麻绳球"景点）
* **make a living**：短语，谋生
* **outexecute** 🔥：动词，在执行上胜过
* **domain**：名词，领域

(25) [26:45-27:25] **Even after the AI takeover, I suspect we will invent things that people will value simply because a human produced them. For instance, you could Spotify yourself the best string quartet for your wedding. Like, you could Spotify and it'll play better than any string quartet you can afford to hire for your wedding. People are still hiring string quartets. Why? Because they love the fact that the Peruvian woman is hand weaving this carpet, right? Like they like the idea that human sweat was behind something. I think human labor will always be valued for the fact that it is human labor.**

即使在 AI 接管之后，我猜测我们会发明出一些东西，人们会仅仅因为是人类生产的而珍视它们。比如，你可以用 **Spotify** 给自己放婚礼上最好的弦乐四重奏。你可以用 Spotify，它会比你能请得起的任何弦乐四重奏演奏得更好。但人们仍然在请弦乐四重奏。为什么？因为他们喜欢这样一个事实——有个秘鲁女人在手工编织这块地毯，对吧？他们喜欢某样东西背后有人类的汗水这个概念。我认为人类劳动将永远因为它是人类劳动这一事实而被珍视。

解析：
* **AI takeover**：短语，AI 接管
* **string quartet**：短语，弦乐四重奏
* **hand weaving**：短语，手工编织
* **human sweat**：短语，人类的汗水（比喻人类的劳动付出）

(26) [27:25-28:12] **Yeah. I guess in a sense if you go to like New York City, right? Obviously there are a lot of cars on the street, but then there are some people who they have like the little horse carriages and they sit on them. It's very spotty here and there in the city, but they're able to charge like $100 just to take it across the street. Because people just value that like almost nostalgic human experience. Absolutely. Like if you consider young people these days buying records again, right? It's like why would you have a clearly inferior product that gets worse every time you play it? Like and the answer is because people have begun to see that perfection is one type of excellence. But this idea of the physically tangible, this idea of the warmth of seeing the music actually spin and play is something that has a quality all its own.**

是的。从某种意义上说，如果你去纽约市，对吧？显然街上有很多汽车，但也有一些人有那种小马车，然后坐在上面。在城市里这里那里都有，但他们能收 100 美元就带你穿过一条街。因为人们就是珍视那种近乎怀旧的人类体验。绝对是的。比如你想想现在年轻人又开始买黑胶唱片了，对吧？为什么你要买一个明显劣质的、每播放一次就会变差的产品呢？答案是因为人们已经开始意识到完美只是卓越的一种类型。但这种实体可触摸的概念、看到音乐真的在旋转播放的温暖感，是一种有其独特品质的东西。

解析：
* **horse carriage**：短语，马车
* **spotty**：形容词，零星的、稀疏的
* **nostalgic** /nɒˈstældʒɪk/：形容词，怀旧的
* **records**：名词，黑胶唱片
* **inferior**：形容词，劣质的、较差的
* **tangible** /ˈtændʒəbl/ 🔥：形容词，有形的、可触摸的

(27) [28:19-29:02] **Right. Yeah. I mean in that regard so we've dabbled on like what types are there anything within computer science you think the human element is still necessary for? I think there are many computer science jobs that don't focus on raw code output right if you think about staged changes in a deployed system that upgrades you from one design to another that's a whole skill in itself like how do you do sorry that one thing you break that down to our audience the god I think we got a young audience. Yeah. So, for instance, let's say you work at a company that has a large web service like Amazon, right? And you have code that's like 20 years old. If you have a new design for a new feature that you want to build, often times the question is, how do you keep the site running while you make the changes that are going to enable your new feature? Yeah. Without regressive bugs, right?**

对。是的。在这方面，我们已经谈了一些，那在计算机科学领域内有什么你认为人类元素仍然是必要的吗？我认为有很多计算机科学工作不专注于原始代码输出，对吧。如果你想想在已部署系统中的分阶段变更，把你从一个设计升级到另一个设计，这本身就是一整套技能，比如你怎么——抱歉，能把这个给观众解释一下吗，我觉得我们的观众很年轻。好的。比如说，假设你在一家拥有大型网络服务的公司工作，像 **Amazon**，对吧？你有大约 20 年历史的代码。如果你有一个新功能的新设计想要构建，问题往往是：你如何在进行这些启用新功能的更改的同时保持网站运行？是的。而且不产生回归 bug，对吧？

解析：
* **dabble on**：短语，涉猎、浅尝
* **raw code output**：短语，原始代码产出
* **staged changes** 🔥：短语，分阶段变更
* **deployed system**：短语，已部署的系统
* **regressive bugs**：短语，回归 bug（修改代码后导致原有功能出错）

(28) [29:02-29:45] **That is something that AI is right now not very good at. Now, one day it will probably be good at it, right? But right now, it isn't. And it's something that human experience can make you very good at. It's a type of decision-making, right? You want to be the type of person who is not trying to primarily bang out code, but the type of person who knows what code would be valuable, knows what traps to avoid, that sort of person. And as you know, the AI is often very often wrong, right? And so, you want to be the type of person who spots wrong things quickly, right? And so those skills, I think, will still be very valuable.**

这是 AI 目前不太擅长的事情。现在，有一天它可能会擅长，对吧？但目前它还不行。而这是人类经验可以让你变得非常擅长的事情。这是一种决策能力，对吧？你要成为那种不是主要在敲代码的人，而是那种知道什么代码是有价值的、知道要避免什么陷阱的人。而且你知道，AI 经常是错的，对吧？所以你要成为那种能快速发现错误的人，对吧？所以我认为这些技能仍然会非常有价值。

解析：
* **bang out code** 🔥：短语，快速写出代码（口语化表达）
* **traps to avoid**：短语，要避免的陷阱
* **spot**：动词，发现、识别

(29) [29:45-30:34] **If you could reflect back a little bit on your own career, but now that you know everything that's going on with AI, what's one piece of advice you would give? I think I would have encouraged my younger self to be a little more thoughtful about what I really wanted in my next job before I just went to a job. I think I often chose jobs because they sounded exciting or because it was, you know, working with a friend or it paid much, right? But I do think that over time it feels like, you know, the biggest optimization you can make with your life on a day-to-day basis is probably find the right partner, sleep on the right bed, right? And then also probably choose a job and a profession and a company that those are probably the biggest optimizations that you could make. And I think many people, for instance, take the company decision. Many people don't reflect more than a week on what company that they should join, right? And I think that's probably the highest offer, right?**

如果你能稍微回顾一下你自己的职业生涯，但现在你知道 AI 正在发生的一切，你会给出什么建议？我想我会鼓励年轻时的自己在接受一份工作之前，更认真地思考我在下一份工作中真正想要什么。我觉得我经常选择工作是因为它们听起来很令人兴奋，或者是和朋友一起工作，或者薪水很高，对吧？但我确实认为，随着时间推移，你能在日常生活中做出的最大优化可能是找到合适的伴侣、睡在合适的床上，对吧？然后可能还有选择一份工作、一个职业、一家公司——这些可能是你能做出的最大优化。我认为很多人，比如在公司选择这件事上，很多人在应该加入什么公司这件事上思考不超过一周，对吧？而我认为这可能是最重要的决定，对吧？

解析：
* **reflect back on**：短语，回顾、反思
* **thoughtful**：形容词，深思熟虑的
* **optimization**：名词，优化
* **on a day-to-day basis**：短语，在日常基础上

(30) [30:34-31:21] **So I do think that those are the right optimizations to really make. Okay, cool. Well, Philip, thank you so much for being on this video. I really hope that you guys got a lot of value out of it. And if you did, make sure to hit the like button, subscribe if you haven't already. Do you have any links that you'd want people to click on, share about? So, one thing I'm working on right now that I would love your feedback about is I'm working on a podcast player for iOS called Superic. It does things no other podcast player does. So, as an example, for instance, right now, no podcast player in the world allows you to subscribe to a topic. You have to subscribe to a feed, right? I think that's nonsensical. Superic lets you subscribe to topics. It does all sorts of stuff. So, would love your feedback on that. So, please tell me what you think. Yeah, for sure. We'll have the links down below in the description. Be sure to check it out and I'll catch you all next.**

所以我确实认为这些才是真正值得做的优化。好的，酷。**Philip**，非常感谢你来参加这个视频。我真的希望你们从中获得了很多价值。如果是的话，确保点赞，如果还没订阅的话就订阅吧。你有什么链接想让大家点击或分享的吗？我现在正在做的一件事，希望得到你们的反馈，是我正在开发一个 iOS 播客播放器叫 **Superic**。它能做其他播客播放器做不到的事情。举个例子，现在世界上没有任何播客播放器允许你订阅一个话题。你只能订阅一个 feed，对吧？我觉得这很不合理。**Superic** 让你可以订阅话题。它能做各种各样的事情。所以希望得到你们对此的反馈。请告诉我你们的想法。好的，当然。我们会把链接放在下面的描述中。一定要去看看，下次见！

解析：
* **hit the like button**：短语，点赞
* **subscribe**：动词，订阅
* **feed**：名词，信息流、订阅源（如 RSS feed）
* **nonsensical** /nɒnˈsensɪkl/：形容词，不合理的、荒谬的
* **catch you**：短语，下次见（口语）
