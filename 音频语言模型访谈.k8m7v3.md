**{Neil, it's awesome [to have you].} {I'm super excited [to chat today].} {Yeah, thanks [for having me].} {Amazing.} {Neil is [the CEO and co-founder] (of Gradium) and also [the co-founder] (of Qoutai), [which is the creator of [some amazing language models] (across the board)].} {Also the inventor of [the specific models] [that takes (a different approach) (from diffusion)] and is more (around audio language models) (end to end).} {And they've done [some really incredible work] [both (in academic literature) as well as (deployed models) (with Gradium)].}**

Neil，很高兴你能来！我今天超兴奋能跟你聊。——谢谢你们邀请我。——太好了。Neil 是 **Gradium** 的 CEO 和联合创始人，同时也是 **Qoutai** 的联合创始人。**Qoutai** 创造了一系列出色的语言模型，Neil 本人也是一些独特模型的发明者——这些模型采用了与扩散模型不同的方法，更多是端到端的音频语言模型。他们在学术论文和通过 **Gradium** 部署的模型两方面都做出了非常出色的工作。

解析：
* **co-founder** /ˌkoʊˈfaʊndər/：联合创始人
* **across the board** 🔥：全面地、各方面
* **diffusion**：扩散（指扩散模型，一种生成式AI技术）
* **end to end**：端到端（系统从输入到输出一体化处理）
* **academic literature**：学术文献/论文
* **deployed models**：已部署的模型（投入实际使用的模型）

(2) [0:25-0:50]

**{And so (super excited) [to hear more] [both about [the kind of novel approach] [that they're taking (at the technical level)] as well as [the novel approach] [that they're taking (from a startup level)] (of being both a nonprofit and building out these models also for application use)].} {Neil, thanks so much [for joining].} {Thanks.} {Thank you.} {I would love [to start off] with like [what is Gradium]?} {What is Qout?} {How do they — what is [the history of them] and [how did they come to be]?}**

所以非常期待能更多了解他们在技术层面采取的创新方法，以及在创业层面的创新——既是非营利组织，同时又构建用于实际应用的模型。Neil，非常感谢你加入。——谢谢。——我想先从这个问题开始：**Gradium** 是什么？**Qout** 是什么？它们的历史是什么，是怎么诞生的？

解析：
* **novel approach** 🔥：新颖的方法/创新方法
* **nonprofit**：非营利组织
* **building out**：构建、拓展
* **come to be**：形成、诞生（how did they come to be = 它们是怎么诞生的）

---

(3) [0:50-1:16]

**{Yeah, so the history starts with Qoutai.} {So we created Qoutai [as a research lab] (in late 2023) and (back then) me and my co-founders (of Qout and Gradium) we were either (at Google or Meta) doing research [on generative models] (around audio) but also (around text and vision) and we wanted [to recreate a new lab] [that was (kind of) like [the early days of (Facebook Research) and (Google Brain) and (Google DeepMind)]] [that we knew].}**

历史要从 **Qoutai** 说起。我们在 2023 年底创建了 **Qoutai** 作为一个研究实验室。那时候，我和 **Qout** 及 **Gradium** 的联合创始人们分别在 **Google** 或 **Meta** 做关于音频以及文本和视觉的生成式模型研究。我们想要重新创建一个实验室，那种类似我们所熟悉的早期 **Facebook Research**、**Google Brain** 和 **Google DeepMind** 的感觉。

解析：
* **research lab**：研究实验室
* **generative models**：生成式模型
* **recreate**：重新创建
* **the early days of** 🔥：……的早期阶段

---

(4) [1:16-1:40]

**{And so we had the choice of [either making a startup or making a nonprofit].} {And (you know) our experience was [that the most appropriate environment [to make breakthrough innovation] is a research environment].} {You can even look at LLMs.} {It was invented (at Google) but it was invented (at Google Brain) and not (in Google product divisions) [because (you know) only a researcher and a research team can take (enough risks) [to rethink everything (from first principles)]].}**

所以我们面临选择：要么创建一家初创公司，要么创建一个非营利组织。我们的经验告诉我们，做出突破性创新最合适的环境是研究环境。看看大语言模型就知道了——它是在 **Google** 发明的，但具体是在 **Google Brain** 而不是 **Google** 的产品部门，因为只有研究人员和研究团队才能承担足够的风险，从第一性原理出发重新思考一切。

解析：
* **breakthrough innovation** 🔥：突破性创新
* **appropriate**：合适的、恰当的
* **first principles** 🔥：第一性原理（从最基本假设出发思考问题的方法）
* **product divisions**：产品部门

---

(5) [1:40-2:05]

**{So since we really wanted [to make (significant) contribution], we wanted [to create an environment] [that will favor that] and the nonprofit was perfect (for that).} {And so we did (you know) two years of [open science publications], training PhD students and so on.} {It has a lot of success.} {Our models are downloaded [millions of times] (every month).} {I'll go into [the details of [what models I'm talking about]] later.}**

因为我们真的想做出重大贡献，所以我们想创造一个有利于此的环境，而非营利组织对此是完美的选择。于是我们做了两年的开放科学出版物，培养博士生等等。成果非常丰富——我们的模型每月被下载数百万次。我稍后会详细介绍我说的是哪些模型。

解析：
* **significant contribution**：重大贡献
* **favor**：有利于、偏向
* **open science publications**：开放科学出版物（公开发表的研究成果）
* **PhD students**：博士生

---

(6) [2:05-2:29]

**{But what we then see is there was (a lot) also of market traction [around having strong models (for real-time voice) as a transcription, synthesis, translation and so on so forth].} {And (with our technical expertise) we could also provide such products.} {So we decided [to create Gradium].} {And Gradium and Qoutai are located [in the same offices].}**

但我们后来发现，市场上对强大的实时语音模型有很大的需求——包括转录、合成、翻译等等。凭借我们的技术专长，我们也能提供这样的产品。所以我们决定创建 **Gradium**。**Gradium** 和 **Qoutai** 在同一个办公室里。

解析：
* **market traction** 🔥：市场吸引力/需求
* **transcription**：转录（将语音转为文字）
* **synthesis**：合成（如语音合成）
* **technical expertise**：技术专长

---

(7) [2:29-2:55]

**{Qoutai is a shareholder (of Gradium).} {We have partnerships.} {So the idea is [to have [long-term fundamental research] [that is open]] and [much more concrete applied research (for products)].} {Yeah, that's awesome.} {I think the — how do you create [that creativity and the ability [to go in (more ambiguous) directions]] and [have that space] versus [doing (very applied) stuff]?} {Makes a lot of —}**

**Qoutai** 是 **Gradium** 的股东，我们有合作关系。所以这个思路就是：一方面有开放的长期基础研究，另一方面有更具体的面向产品的应用研究。——很棒。我觉得关键问题是，你怎样才能创造出那种创造力和朝更模糊方向探索的能力和空间，而不是只做非常应用化的东西？

解析：
* **shareholder**：股东
* **fundamental research**：基础研究
* **applied research**：应用研究
* **ambiguous** /æmˈbɪɡjuəs/：模糊的、不明确的
* **versus** 🔥：相对于、与……对比

---

(8) [2:55-3:20]

**{Yeah, I can say a few words about that.} {So for example, the first project [we did (at Qoutai)] was Moshi.} {So the idea was, (you know,) (back then) the state of the art (in audio) was [text to speech] and [speech to text].} {There was no conversational AI whatsoever, right?} {It didn't even — you could start [building a cascaded system], but it didn't even really exist.} {And this is — what year — it was like 2023 [to have something [that works (really really) well]].}**

嗯，关于这点我可以说几句。比如，我们在 **Qoutai** 做的第一个项目就是 **Moshi**。当时的情况是，音频领域最先进的技术就是文本转语音和语音转文本。根本没有对话式 AI——你可以开始构建一个级联系统，但它实际上并不真正存在。那是 2023 年，要做出一个真正好用的东西。

解析：
* **state of the art** 🔥：最先进的技术/水平
* **text to speech / speech to text**：文本转语音（**TTS**）/ 语音转文本（**STT**）
* **conversational AI**：对话式AI
* **whatsoever**：任何（强调否定，= at all）
* **cascaded system**：级联系统（多个模块串联处理的系统）

---

(9) [3:20-3:48]

**{So what we decided to do was to do something [that was (very) new] [that didn't need (too much) compute] because (you know) we were four [in the original team] — four people.} {We had 1,000 GPUs [which may sound like a lot] but it was already like [10 times or 20 times smaller] than (you know) a similar team (in a big tech company).} {So we could not go (like) for [the gigantic foundation reasoning model], right?}**

所以我们决定做一些非常新、又不需要太多算力的东西——因为我们最初的团队只有 4 个人。我们有 1000 个 **GPU**，听起来可能很多，但已经比大型科技公司类似团队的规模小了 10 到 20 倍。所以我们不可能去搞那种巨型基础推理模型。

解析：
* **compute**：算力（计算资源）
* **GPU**：图形处理器（用于AI训练的硬件）
* **gigantic** /dʒaɪˈɡæntɪk/：巨大的
* **foundation reasoning model**：基础推理模型

---

(10) [3:48-4:13]

**{And what I saw is [nobody had made (any) progress on this].} {We could have something [that would (mostly) build on our expertise] and (you know) [with smart architecture] could be trained [on a few dozens of GPUs] and [that would impress everyone] [to make this kind of real-time voice].} {So we went directly for training [a full duplex conversational model].} {So full duplex — it's not only [a conversational model] but [there is no turn taking whatsoever].}**

而且我注意到，这个方向上没有人取得任何进展。我们可以做出一个主要建立在我们专业知识基础上的东西，通过巧妙的架构设计，只需几十个 **GPU** 就能训练，而且能让所有人都印象深刻——做出这种实时语音。所以我们直接去训练了一个全双工对话模型。全双工的意思是——它不仅是一个对话模型，而且完全没有轮次切换。

解析：
* **build on** 🔥：建立在……之上
* **expertise** /ˌekspɜːrˈtiːz/：专业知识/专长
* **full duplex** 🔥：全双工（通信术语，指双方可同时发送和接收信号）
* **turn taking**：轮次切换（对话中一方说完另一方再说）

---

(11) [4:13-4:37]

**{Like the model is listening (all the time) and speaking (all the time).} {When it doesn't speak, it still generates audio but it's silent audio.} {So it was really [bringing the world (from Alexa and Siri) to [a human-like conversation]].} {And we (in 6 months) were able [to ship that] [with a team (as I said) of (four people) (in the beginning) and (like six) (at the end)].} {So it was quite challenging but it was —}**

模型一直在听，也一直在说。当它不说话的时候，它仍然在生成音频——只不过是静默音频。所以这真的是把世界从 **Alexa** 和 **Siri** 带到了类人对话的层次。我们在 6 个月内就交付了这个产品，团队一开始是 4 个人，最后大概 6 个人。这确实很有挑战性——

解析：
* **silent audio**：静默音频（模型输出的空白/无声音频）
* **human-like conversation**：类人对话
* **ship** 🔥：交付、发布（产品上线，创业圈高频用词）
* **challenging** /ˈtʃælɪndʒɪŋ/：有挑战性的

---

(12) [4:37-5:02]

**{It is interesting — in voice, [a small team can make a big difference] [because since the models are (much smaller) (than large reasoning models)] it's really more about [how deep you are (into voice)] and [you understand [how to build these systems]] and you can be very competitive.} {Which is — that way I think [it makes it [a very good application (for startups)]], right?} {When you look at [reasoning model, video generation and so on], it requires [very large training infrastructure], [very large access to data] and so on.}**

有趣的是——在语音领域，小团队可以产生巨大影响。因为模型比大型推理模型小得多，关键在于你对语音的理解有多深、你有多了解如何构建这些系统，你就能非常有竞争力。这使得语音成为一个非常适合创业公司的应用方向。而你看推理模型、视频生成等等，它们需要非常庞大的训练基础设施和海量数据。

解析：
* **make a big difference** 🔥：产生巨大影响
* **competitive**：有竞争力的
* **training infrastructure**：训练基础设施
* **access to data**：数据获取渠道

---

(13) [5:02-5:27]

**{So it's much more difficult (for a small actor) [to be meaningful].} {In voice there is [a lot of space to take].} {Yeah, that's really cool too because, yeah, I think [as you said] a lot of the labs aren't prioritizing this (compared to other spaces).} {And then there's also [interesting parts (of the speech models)] where like TTS is [a lot cheaper (to train)].} {So that really highlights [why there are [so many TTS models (out there)]] and [why [so many people] have come into [that part of the space]].}**

所以小团队要在那些领域有所作为要困难得多。而在语音领域有很多空间可以占据。——确实很酷，正如你所说，很多实验室并没有优先关注语音领域。而且语音模型中还有一些有趣的方面，比如 **TTS** 的训练成本低得多。这也解释了为什么市面上有这么多 **TTS** 模型，为什么这么多人都涌入了这个方向。

解析：
* **small actor**：小玩家、小参与者
* **prioritizing**：优先考虑
* **TTS (Text to Speech)**：文本转语音
* **highlights**：突出、强调
* **out there** 🔥：在外面、市面上（口语中指公开存在的）

---

(14) [5:27-5:52]

**{In terms of — like Moshi — so when Moshi was released, like what were you — maybe give a description of [what the Moshi model was] (for everyone) and then also kind of [where it's come (since then)].} {Yeah.} {So the underlying (let's say) big principle is [audio language models].} {So basically (in audio generation) you have roughly [two families of model].} {One is diffusion models.}**

说到 **Moshi**——当 **Moshi** 发布的时候，能不能给大家描述一下 **Moshi** 模型是什么，以及它后来发展到了哪里？——好的。基本原理就是音频语言模型。在音频生成领域，大致有两大类模型。第一类是扩散模型。

解析：
* **in terms of** 🔥：就……而言、说到……
* **underlying principle**：基本原理
* **roughly**：大致、大约
* **family of model**：模型家族/类别
* **diffusion models**：扩散模型

---

(15) [5:52-6:15]

**{And so typically [when you see an audio spectrogram], (you know,) like [a time-frequency representation (of sound)] [where you see [all the frequency bands and the energy]], so you can see it as an image and you can train [the same kind of algorithms [that are used (for image generation)]] but [to generate the spectrogram] and then you're going to reconstruct, (you know,) transform the spectrogram in audio.}**

通常，当你看一个音频频谱图——也就是声音的时频表示，你能看到所有的频段和能量——你可以把它看作一张图像。然后你可以用与图像生成相同的算法来生成频谱图，再把频谱图重建、转换回音频。

解析：
* **spectrogram** /ˈspektrəɡræm/：频谱图
* **time-frequency representation**：时频表示
* **frequency bands**：频段/频带
* **reconstruct**：重建、还原
* **algorithm** /ˈælɡərɪðəm/：算法

---

(16) [6:15-6:40]

**{So that's diffusion models (for audio).} {The nice thing is [it can provide (very) high quality] but they do not process audio sequentially.} {So they are going to process [everything (at once)] and so they're incompatible (with real-time inference).} {What we proposed and introduced [(when I was at Google)] and [we have been working on (for now more than five years)] is [an audio language model].} {So it all started with SoundStream.}**

这就是音频领域的扩散模型。好处是它能提供非常高的质量，但它们不是按顺序处理音频的——它们一次性处理所有内容，因此与实时推理不兼容。而我们提出并引入的——这是我在 **Google** 时开始的，我们已经做了五年多——是音频语言模型。一切都始于 **SoundStream**。

解析：
* **sequentially** /sɪˈkwenʃəli/：按顺序地
* **at once**：一次性、同时
* **incompatible** 🔥：不兼容的
* **real-time inference**：实时推理
* **proposed and introduced**：提出并引入

---

(17) [6:40-7:04]

**{So it was a codec [that my team and I developed].} {So the idea was just [to create a new codec (for real-time communication) like (in particular) video conferencing].} {So that will be like [a neural network [that takes an audio and compresses it (so efficiently)] [that (even with a very bad network connectivity) you can have (high quality)]].} {So it was really (for Google Meet) [that we developed that].}**

它是一个由我和我的团队开发的编解码器。最初的想法就是为实时通信创建一个新的编解码器，特别是用于视频会议。它本质上是一个神经网络，能把音频压缩得非常高效，即使网络连接很差也能保持高质量。我们确实是为 **Google Meet** 开发的。

解析：
* **codec** /ˈkoʊdek/ 🔥：编解码器（编码+解码的缩写）
* **real-time communication**：实时通信
* **video conferencing**：视频会议
* **neural network**：神经网络
* **connectivity**：连接性、网络连接

---

(18) [7:04-7:29]

**{But then we realized [okay we have this very large audio waveform] and (at the time) everybody was generating audio [with generative adversarial networks].} {So it was great [if you want to generate (like 3 to 5 seconds of) audio].} {But [if you want to generate (one minute of audio)], it just doesn't work (at all).} {It doesn't scale [to this kind of long-form generation].} {And we were seeing (at the same time) [that the transformer architecture (for language modeling) was working (very well)].}**

但后来我们意识到，我们有这么大的音频波形，而当时所有人都在用生成对抗网络来生成音频。如果你想生成 3 到 5 秒的音频，那很棒。但如果你想生成一分钟的音频，它完全不行——它无法扩展到这种长形式的生成。与此同时，我们看到 **Transformer** 架构在语言建模方面表现非常好。

解析：
* **waveform**：波形
* **generative adversarial network (GAN)** 🔥：生成对抗网络
* **scale** 🔥：扩展、可扩展（scale to = 扩展到）
* **long-form generation**：长形式生成
* **transformer architecture**：**Transformer** 架构

---

(19) [7:29-7:55]

**{We tried [to adapt that (to our setting)].} {And so what we did is [we looked at our codec and realized] okay, we are compressing audio (so efficiently) that [the resulting codes (of the codec)] they are [a bit like text] — they are [very compressed representation].} {And so [what if we could train just [an audio language model] [which will be like [the exact same architecture (as a text language model)] but [instead of predicting (text tokens)] it predicts codes [that are like (audio tokens)]]]?} {And so it took (I don't know) like 5 days [to implement].}**

我们试着把它适配到我们的场景。我们研究了自己的编解码器，发现我们把音频压缩得如此高效，以至于编解码器输出的编码有点像文本——它们是非常压缩的表示。那如果我们直接训练一个音频语言模型呢？它的架构跟文本语言模型完全一样，只不过不是预测文本 **token**，而是预测类似音频 **token** 的编码。实现这个大概只用了 5 天。

解析：
* **adapt to** 🔥：适配到、调整以适应
* **compressed representation**：压缩表示
* **token**：令牌（AI中的基本处理单元）
* **implement**：实现、实施
* **what if** 🔥：如果……会怎样（假设性提问）

---

(20) [7:55-8:20]

**{We ran our first experiment and instantly we realized [we had tackled (instant) voice cloning].} {So (for the first time in the world) you would prefix — the same way [you prompt a text model] — you will prefix your model [with like three seconds (from someone's voice)] and you will keep speaking (in their voice).} {And so this became (extremely) easy (for us) [to then do [pretty much any task]].} {So we did music, then it gave NotebookLM [to generate a dialogue (for podcast)] — (you know) it was a very popular product (at Google) — translation and so on.}**

我们运行了第一个实验，立刻就意识到我们解决了即时语音克隆的问题。世界上第一次，你可以像给文本模型写提示词一样，用某人的三秒钟语音作为前缀，然后模型就会继续用那个人的声音说话。这使得我们几乎可以轻松完成任何任务——我们做了音乐生成，然后它催生了 **NotebookLM** 用来生成播客对话——这在 **Google** 是一个非常受欢迎的产品——还有翻译等等。

解析：
* **tackled** 🔥：解决了、攻克了
* **voice cloning**：语音克隆
* **prefix**：前缀（这里用作动词，给模型加前缀输入）
* **prompt**：提示（给AI模型的输入指令）
* **pretty much** 🔥：几乎、差不多

---

(21) [8:20-8:50]

**{So it was (you know) just as versatile as [text LLMs], (you know) just pretty much doing [every task (at once)].} {So it was extremely interesting.} {And the very nice thing is [that we could always exploit [what the text community was doing]].} {So for example [when the text community distilled [large text models] (into small text models)], we could distill [large speech models] (into small ones).} {When they did [speculative decoding], we got [speculative decoding].} {When all the papers around [reasoning models] and so on, we were able [to integrate it (in our speech models)].}**

所以它就像文本大语言模型一样全能，几乎能同时做所有任务。这非常有趣。而且最棒的一点是，我们可以一直借鉴文本社区在做的事情。比如，当文本社区把大型文本模型蒸馏成小型文本模型时，我们也能把大型语音模型蒸馏成小的。当他们做推测性解码时，我们也能用上。当关于推理模型的论文出来时，我们也能把它整合到我们的语音模型中。

解析：
* **versatile** /ˈvɜːrsətl/ 🔥：多用途的、全能的
* **exploit**：利用、借鉴（中性用法，非贬义）
* **distill** 🔥：蒸馏（AI术语，将大模型的知识压缩到小模型中）
* **speculative decoding** 🔥：推测性解码（一种加速推理的技术）
* **integrate**：整合、集成

---

(22) [8:50-9:16]

**{So it was just like also [you would see the progress (on the hardware) [being so tailored (for the transformer architecture and LLMs)]] [that we could just (you know) benefit from it as well].} {So we are like [riding (for free) the LLM wave] but just with audio.} {So this has been [a very very productive framework].} {And what we did with Moshi is [a very simple idea (conceptually)]: [instead of predicting [a single stream (of audio tokens)] you have two (in parallel)].}**

而且硬件方面的进步也是如此——硬件越来越为 **Transformer** 架构和大语言模型量身定制，我们也能从中受益。所以我们就像是免费搭乘了大语言模型的浪潮，只不过是用音频而已。这是一个非常高产的框架。我们用 **Moshi** 做的事情在概念上非常简单：不是预测单一的音频 **token** 流，而是并行预测两个。

解析：
* **tailored for** 🔥：为……量身定制
* **riding the wave** 🔥：搭乘浪潮（利用趋势获益）
* **productive framework**：高产的框架
* **in parallel**：并行地
* **conceptually**：在概念上

---

(23) [9:16-9:46]

**{So one is going to be the user and one is going to be the AI.} {And since the two are run (in parallel), [instead of having [a strict delimitation (of speaker turns)] [where either you're speaking or you're listening]], both can speak (at the same time).} {Both can be silent (at the same time).} {You have [no voice activity detection whatsoever].} {Anyone [who has played (in our audience) with (voice activity detection parameters)] knows [how painful it is].} {So it was just [a very simple framework] [that would solve the challenging task] — [which (when you're a scientist) is exactly [what you're looking for]].}**

一个代表用户，一个代表 AI。因为两者是并行运行的，所以不需要严格划分说话者的轮次——不是"要么你在说要么在听"——双方可以同时说话，也可以同时沉默。你完全不需要语音活动检测。在座任何调过语音活动检测参数的人都知道那有多痛苦。所以这就是一个非常简单的框架，却能解决具有挑战性的任务——作为科学家，这正是你想要的。

解析：
* **delimitation**：界定、划分
* **speaker turns**：说话者轮次
* **voice activity detection (VAD)** 🔥：语音活动检测（检测何时有人在说话）
* **parameters**：参数
* **painful** 🔥：痛苦的（口语中常用来形容难搞的事）

---

(24) [9:46-10:11]

**{Yeah, I think this problem of [turn taking being interruptions or latency] — you're really constantly just flip-flopping between [either you're not acknowledging [when the user barges in]], you're not acknowledging interruptions, or you're interrupting the user, or you are causing [too much or too little latency] [so that it's unnatural]].} {And I think [that definitely is the promise (of speech-to-speech models)]: [that you have that full context] and you can model — it's just [a question of [how much data you're inputting]] — you can model back [that similar speech patterns].}**

是的，轮次切换带来的打断和延迟问题——你真的就是在不停地来回摇摆：要么你没有在用户插嘴的时候做出回应，要么你打断了用户，要么你造成了太多或太少的延迟导致不自然。而我认为这就是端到端语音模型的愿景：你拥有完整的上下文，可以建模——这只是你输入多少数据的问题——你可以建模出类似的语音模式。

解析：
* **flip-flopping** 🔥：来回摇摆、反复不定
* **acknowledge**：回应、确认
* **barge in** 🔥：插嘴、闯入
* **latency** /ˈleɪtənsi/ 🔥：延迟（系统响应时间）
* **speech-to-speech models**：端到端语音模型
* **speech patterns**：语音模式/说话模式

---

(25) [10:11-10:37]

**{So I guess [why are speech-to-speech models not everywhere right now]?} {Like this sounds amazing.} {Like you have this supernatural speech pattern.} {You can clone voices.} {You can create like — NotebookLM was amazing [because you were able to have [a very podcast style]] or you could have [a more customer service — "I'm speaking on the phone" — [which sounds different (than a news broadcaster)]].}**

那我就想问了——为什么端到端语音模型现在还没有到处普及？听起来太厉害了——你有这种超自然的语音模式，你可以克隆声音。你可以创造各种风格——**NotebookLM** 之所以惊艳，是因为你可以实现非常播客化的风格，也可以做成客服在打电话的感觉——而这听起来跟新闻播报员完全不同。

解析：
* **supernatural**：超自然的（这里指非常逼真、超越常规的）
* **clone voices**：克隆声音
* **podcast style**：播客风格
* **customer service**：客户服务
* **news broadcaster**：新闻播报员

## 📚 段落小结

这段访谈介绍了 **Neil** 和他创建的两家组织：非营利研究实验室 **Qoutai** 和商业公司 **Gradium**。核心技术是音频语言模型——不同于扩散模型，它基于 **SoundStream** 编解码器将音频压缩为类似文本的 token，然后用与文本大语言模型相同的 **Transformer** 架构来生成音频。他们的突破性项目 **Moshi** 是一个全双工对话模型，通过并行预测用户和 AI 两个音频流，消除了传统语音系统中的轮次切换和语音活动检测问题。
