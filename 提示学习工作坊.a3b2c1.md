(2) [0:34-0:51] **Um I come from a technical background and started off in data science before I made my way over to product. Uh I do like to still be touching code today. I think one of my favorite projects that I work on is building our own agent Alex into our platform. So I'm very familiar with all of the pain points um and how important it is to optimize your prompt.**

嗯，我技术背景出身，最开始做 **data science**，后来转到 **product**。我现在仍然喜欢接触 **code**。我最喜欢的项目之一是把我们自己的 **agent Alex** 集成到平台里。所以我很熟悉各种 **pain points**，也知道优化 **prompt** 有多重要。

(5) [1:15-1:32] **Uh, so my name is I'm a product manager here at Arise as well. And like Sally said, we like to stay in code. We'll be doing a few slides, then we'll walk through the code and we'll be floating around helping you guys debug and things like that. My background is also technical. So, I was a backend distributed systems engineer for a long time.**

呃，我叫……我也是 **Arise** 的 **product manager**。就像 **Sally** 说的，我们喜欢待在 **code** 里。我们会做几张 **slides**，然后过一遍 **code**，期间会在旁边帮大家 **debug** 等。我的背景也偏技术，我做 **backend distributed systems engineer** 很久了。

(6) [1:32-1:44] **So, no stranger to how important observability infrastructure really is. Um, and I think it's an appropriate setting in AWS for that. So, yeah, excited to dive deep into front loading with you all. Thank you. Awesome.**

所以我对 **observability infrastructure** 的重要性并不陌生。我觉得在 **AWS** 里做这件事很合适。总之，很期待和大家一起深入 **front loading**。谢谢。太棒了。

解析：
* **no stranger to** 🔥：对…并不陌生
* **dive deep into** 🔥：深入钻研/深入讨论
* **语法点**：be excited to + 动词原形

---

(7) [1:44-2:08] **All right, so we're gonna get started. Just give you a little bit of an agenda of the things I'm going to be covering. Uh, so we're gonna talk about why agents fail today. what is evening prom learning? I want to go through a case study kind of show youall why this actually works. Uh and we'll talk about learning versus GA. I think everybody I had a few people come up to me over the conference about like what about GEA? Uh we have some benchmarking against that and then we'll hop into our workshop.**

好，我们开始。我先给大家一个 **agenda**，说说我要覆盖哪些内容。我们会聊为什么 **agents** 会失败，什么是 **evening prom learning**。我想通过一个 **case study** 给大家看它为什么真的有效。我们还会聊 **learning** versus **GA**。有几位在会上问我 **GEA** 怎么样，我们有一些 **benchmarking**，然后就进入工作坊。

解析：
* **agenda**：议程
* **go through**：过一遍/讲解
* **语法点**：be going to + 动词，表示计划

---

(8) [2:08-2:21] **but with this I want to ask a question. How many people here are building agents today? Okay, that's what I expected. Um and how many people actually feel like the agents they're building are reliable? Yeah, that's what I also thought.**

不过在这之前我想问个问题：现场有多少人在做 **agents**？好的，这正如我预料。那有多少人觉得自己做的 **agents** 是 **reliable** 的？对，我也这么想。

解析：
* **feel like**：觉得/感觉
* **reliable**：可靠的（形容词）
* **语法点**：How many people + are + V-ing

---

(9) [2:21-2:38] **let's talk a little bit about why agents fail today. So why do they fail? Well, there's a few things that we're seeing with a lot of our folks and we're seeing even internally as we build with Alex for why agents are b breaking. So um I think that a lot of times it's not because the models are weak. It's a lot of times the environment um and the instructions are weak.**

我们聊聊 **agents** 今天为什么会失败。为什么会失败？我们在很多用户那里、也在内部用 **Alex** 构建时看到了一些原因。很多时候不是 **models** 弱，而是 **environment** 和 **instructions** 弱。

解析：
* **a lot of times** 🔥：很多时候
* **not because A, but because B**：对比说明原因
* **语法点**：that 引导定语从句，修饰 things

---

(10) [2:38-2:56] **So uh having no instructions um from their learned environment uh no planning or very static planning. I feel like a lot of agents right now don't have planning. We do have some good examples of planning like we have cloud code cursor. Those are really great examples but I'm not seeing it make its way into every agent that I come across.**

比如没有从学习到的 **environment** 得到 **instructions**，没有 **planning** 或只有很静态的 **planning**。我感觉现在很多 **agents** 没有 **planning**。我们确实有一些好的 **planning** 例子，比如 **cloud code**、**cursor**，但我没看到它普及到我遇到的每个 **agent**。

解析：
* **make its way into** 🔥：逐渐进入/普及到
* **come across** 🔥：遇到/碰到
* **语法点**：I'm not seeing + 宾语 + 动词原形

---

(11) [2:56-3:06] **Uh missing tools big one. Sometimes you just don't have the tool sets that you need. Uh and then missing kind of tool guidance on like which of the tools we should be picking and then context engineering continues to be a big struggle for folks.**

还有一个大问题是 **missing tools**。有时你就是没有需要的 **tool sets**。另外也缺少 **tool guidance**，不知道该选哪个 **tool**，再加上 **context engineering** 仍是很多人的大难题。

解析：
* **tool set**：工具集合
* **guidance**：指导/指引（名词）
* **语法点**：continue to be + 名词，表示“仍然是…”

---

(12) [3:06-3:28] **If I were to distill this out, I think it's like these three core issues. So adaptability and selfarning. Um so no system instructions learned from the environment touched on determinism versus non-determinism balance. So having the planning um or no planning versus doing like a very static planning. You want to kind of have some flexibility there.**

如果把它提炼一下，我觉得有三大核心问题：**adaptability** 和 **selfarning**，以及没有从 **environment** 学到的 **system instructions**，还有 **determinism** 与 **non-determinism** 的平衡。再就是 **planning** 有或没有、太静态或太固定——需要一定 **flexibility**。

解析：
* **distill this out** 🔥：提炼/总结出来
* **determinism vs non-determinism**：确定性与非确定性
* **语法点**：If I were to..., I think...（虚拟语气）

---

(13) [3:28-3:46] **And then context engineering I think is a term that just kind of emerged in the last like you know six to eight months but it's something that's really really important that we're finding you know missing tools tool guidance just not having context or confirming your data and not giving the LM enough context. So these are um kind of the core issues to still.**

另外 **context engineering** 这个词大概在最近六到八个月才出现，但它非常重要。我们发现的问题包括 **missing tools**、**tool guidance** 不足、缺少 **context** 或没有确认数据、不给 **LM** 足够的 **context**。这些仍然是核心问题。

解析：
* **emerged**：出现/兴起
* **confirming your data**：核对/确认数据
* **语法点**：that 引导定语从句，修饰 term

---

(14) [3:46-4:20] **But I think there's one other pretty important thing. Um and that is kind of this distribution of who's responsible for what. So um there's these technical users, your AI engineers, your data scientists, developers, and they're really responsible for the code automation pipelines actually, you know, managing the performance and costs. But then we have our domain experts, subject matter experts, AI product managers. These are the ones that actually knew what the user experience would be. they probably are super familiar with um the principles that we're actually building to our AI applications. They're tracking our evals and they're really trying to ensure that the product success.**

但我觉得还有一件很重要的事：谁负责什么的 **distribution**（职责分工）。技术用户，比如 **AI engineers**、**data scientists**、**developers**，负责 **code automation pipelines**，管理性能和成本。另一方面是 **domain experts**、**subject matter experts**、**AI product managers**，他们了解用户体验，熟悉我们在 **AI applications** 上的原则，跟踪 **evals**，并尽力保证产品成功。

解析：
* **distribution of who's responsible for what**：职责分工
* **subject matter experts**：领域专家
* **语法点**：be responsible for + 名词

---

(15) [4:20-4:37] **So there's this split between responsibilities but everybody is contributing but then there's this difference um in terms of like maybe technical abilities. And so with prompt learning it's going to be a combination of all these things. So everybody's going to really need to be involved and we can talk about that uh a little bit more.**

因此职责有分工，但大家都在贡献，同时技术能力上也有差异。**prompt learning** 需要把这些因素结合起来，所以每个人都需要参与，我们稍后再多聊一点。

解析：
* **split between**：在…之间的分工/分裂
* **in terms of**：就…而言
* **语法点**：be going to + 名词，表示“将会是…”

---

(16) [4:37-4:56] **So what even is prompting? I'm going to first kind of go through some of the um approaches that we kind of borrowed when we came up with prompt learning. So this is something that Arise has been really really uh dedicated to doing some research. And so one of the first things we borrow from uh which is reinforcement learning. How many folks here are familiar with how reinforcement learning works? All right, cool.**

那 **prompting** 到底是什么？我先讲讲我们提出 **prompt learning** 时借鉴的一些方法。**Arise** 在这方面投入了很多研究。我们借鉴的第一个方法是 **reinforcement learning**。现场有多少人熟悉 **reinforcement learning** 的工作方式？好，很棒。

解析：
* **go through**：讲解/梳理
* **be dedicated to**：致力于（后接动名词）
* **语法点**：How many folks...（提问句式）

---

(17) [4:56-5:31] **Um so if I were to give like a really like silly kind of analogy, we have a reinforcement model. Uh pretend it's like a a student brain that we're trying to kind of, you know, boost up. And so they're going to take an action uh which might be something like you're just going to take a test an exam and there's going to be a score. A teacher is going to come through and actually you know score the exam here um that's going to produce this kind of like scaler reward um and you know pretend the student has an algorithm in their brain that can just kind of take those scores and update the weights in their brain and kind of like the learning behavior there and then we kind of reprocess. So you know in this kind of reinforcement one we're updating weights based off of some scalers.**

如果用一个有点傻的类比：我们有一个 **reinforcement model**，把它当作要被“增强”的学生大脑。它会采取一个 **action**，比如去参加考试并得到 **score**。老师来评分，产生一个 **scalar reward**；假设学生大脑里有算法，能利用分数更新 **weights**，调整学习行为，再重复这一过程。所以在这种 **reinforcement** 里，我们是根据 **scalers** 来更新 **weights** 的。

解析：
* **analogy**：类比
* **take an action**：采取行动
* **scalar reward / weights**：标量奖励/权重
* **语法点**：which might be...（定语从句）

---

(18) [5:31-5:44] **Um, but it's really actually difficult to update the weights directly, especially in like the LLM world. So, reinforcement learning isn't going to quite work that well uh when we're we're doing things like prompting.**

但直接更新 **weights** 其实很难，尤其在 **LLM** 的世界里。所以当我们做 **prompting** 这类事情时，**reinforcement learning** 并不太好用。

解析：
* **update ... directly**：直接更新…
* **LLM**：大语言模型
* **语法点**：isn't going to + 动词，表示“不会/难以”

---

(19) [5:44-6:25] **So, then there's metaprompting, which is very close to what we do with uh prompt learning, but still not quite right. So, here with metal prompting, we're asking LM to improve the prompt. Uh, so again, we use that kind of like student example. We have an agent which is our student. Um, and it's going to produce some kind of output like that's a user asking a question getting an output. That's our test in this example. And then we're going to score. Eval is pretty much what you can think of there. Uh, where it's going to output a score and from there we have like the metapromp thing. So now the teacher is kind of like the metapar prompt. It's going to take the result uh from our scorer and update the prompts based off of that.**

接着是 **metaprompting**，它和 **prompt learning** 很接近，但还不够。这里的 **metal prompting** 是让 **LM** 去改进 **prompt**。还是用学生类比：有一个 **agent** 作为学生，会产出 **output**，比如用户提问得到输出，这就是测试。然后我们 **score**，也就是 **Eval**。接着“老师”——**metapromp** / **metapar prompt**——拿到 **scorer** 的结果，并据此更新 **prompts**。

解析：
* **be close to**：接近/类似
* **based off of**：基于…
* **语法点**：which 引导定语从句

---

(20) [6:25-7:07] **Um, but it's still not quite what we want to do. And that's where we kind of introduce this idea of prompt learning. So prompt learning is going to take the the exam going to produce an output. Um we're going to have our enlumm evals on there. But there's also this really important piece which is the English feedback. So which answers were wrong? Why were the answers wrong? Where the student needs to actually study? Really pinpointing those issues. And then we still aren't using metapro. We still are asking an LLM uh to improve the prompt. It's just the information that we are giving that LLM uh is quite different. And so we're going to update uh the prompt there with all of this kind of feedback. So from our evals from a subject matter expert going in and labeling and use that uh to kind of boost our prompt with better instructions and sometimes exams.**

但这仍不是我们想要的，于是提出 **prompt learning**。**prompt learning** 里会有一次考试产出 **output**，并加入 **enlumm evals**。更重要的是 **English feedback**：哪些答案错了、为什么错、学生需要学什么，精准定位问题。我们仍然让 **LLM** 改进 **prompt**，只是给它的信息不同了。我们会用这些反馈更新 **prompt**，包括来自 **subject matter expert** 的标注，用更好的 **instructions**，有时还有 **exams**，来提升 **prompt**。

解析：
* **introduce this idea of**：引入…的概念
* **pinpoint** 🔥：精准指出
* **语法点**：It's just... that...（强调差异）

---

(21) [7:15-7:34] **So this is kind of like the traditional prompt optimization where it's like we have we're kind of treating it like an ML where we have our data and we have the prompt. We're saying optimize this prompt and maximize our like prediction impulse. Um but that doesn't quite work uh for Allens were missing a lot of context. So what we really found um is that the human instructions of why it failed.**

这有点像传统的 **prompt optimization**：把它当作 **ML**，有数据和 **prompt**，然后说“优化这个 **prompt**，最大化 **prediction impulse**”。但这并不太奏效，因为 **Allens** 缺了很多 **context**。我们真正发现的是，人类对失败原因的 **instructions**。

解析：
* **treat ... like**：把…当作…
* **maximize**：最大化（动词）
* **语法点**：where 引导定语从句

---

(22) [7:34-8:14] **So imagine you have your application data, your traces, a data set, whatever it is. Your subject matter expert goes in and they're not only annotating correct or incorrect. They're saying this is why this is wrong. It failed to adhere to this key instruction. It didn't adhere to the context. It's missing out whatever it is. Um, and then you also have your ego explanations from Ellen as a judge, which is same kind of principle where instead of just the label, it provides the reasoning behind the label. And then we're pointing it at the exact instructions um to change. We're changing the system prompt to help it improve so that we then get, you know, prediction labels, but we also get those evals um and explanations of it. So, we're just kind of optimizing more than just um our outlet here.**

想象你有 **application data**、**traces**、**data set** 等。**subject matter expert** 进去后不只是标注对错，还会说为什么错：没遵循某条关键 **instruction**，没遵循 **context**，或者缺了什么。接着还有作为评审的 **Ellen** 给出的 **ego explanations**，原理类似：不只是给标签，还会给出标签背后的理由。然后我们把它指向需要修改的具体 **instructions**，去改 **system prompt**，让它变好，于是既得到 **prediction labels**，也得到 **evals** 和解释。也就是说，我们优化的不只是 **output** 本身。

解析：
* **adhere to** 🔥：遵循/符合
* **instead of**：不是…而是…
* **语法点**：so that + 结果

---

(23) [8:21-8:45] **And I think a really key learning that we've had is the explanations in human instructions or through your own as a judge. That text is really really valuable. I think that's what we see not being utilized in a lot of other broad optimization approaches. Um they're either kind of optimizing for a score uh or they're just paying attention to the output. But you can think of it this way. It's like these elements are operating in the text domain. So we have all this rich text that tells us exactly what it needs to do to improve. why wouldn't we use that to actually improve our so um that's kind of the basics of prompt learning**

我们一个很重要的 **key learning** 是：人类 **instructions** 或“评审解释”里的文字非常有价值。很多其他 **optimization approaches** 没有充分利用这些文本——要么只优化 **score**，要么只看 **output**。换个角度想，这些元素都在 **text domain** 里运作，我们有大量 **rich text** 清楚告诉我们该怎么改进，为什么不利用它来真正提升 **prompt learning** 呢？这就是 **prompt learning** 的基本思路。

解析：
* **not being utilized**：未被利用
* **text domain**：文本域
* **语法点**：why wouldn't we...（反问强调）

---

(24) [8:53-9:12] **but everybody always comes up to me and like sounds great s but does it actually work um it does and we have some examples of when we do this so we did a little bit of a case study um I think coding agents everybody is pretty much using them at this point there's a quite a few that have been really really successful I think cloud code is a great example cursor but there's also client uh which is more of a um an open version of this and so we decided to take a look and compare to see if we could you know do anything to improve.**

但大家总会问我：听起来很好，可真的有效吗？有效，我们有一些例子，所以做了一个小 **case study**。现在几乎人人都在用 **coding agents**，其中有不少非常成功，比如 **cloud code**、**cursor**，还有更开放版本的 **client**。于是我们决定对比看看能否做些改进。

解析：
* **come up to me**：走过来找我/来问我
* **pretty much**：基本上/几乎
* **语法点**：does it actually work?（一般疑问句强调效果）

---

(25) [9:19-10:04] **So these are kind of the the baseline of where we started here. Um you can see the difference between the different models. U obviously using two and throttle kind of the state-of-the-art there but we also had this opportunity where CL was using you know 45 and it was working decently well at 30% versus 40. Um and then there was kind of the conversation around. So this is where we started um and we took a pass optimizing the system prompt here. So you can see this is what the old one was looking like. It has like no rules section. So it was just very like you are a cloud agent. You're built on this model. You're you're here to do coding. Um but there was no rules and so we took a pass at updating the system.**

这些就是我们起步时的 **baseline**。你可以看到不同 **models** 的差异。显然使用 **two** 和 **throttle** 属于 **state-of-the-art**，但我们也有机会看到 **CL** 用 **45** 时，在 30% 对比 40% 的情况下也表现不错。于是大家讨论了一下，这就是我们开始的地方。接着我们尝试优化 **system prompt**：旧版本几乎没有 **rules section**，只是说你是一个 **cloud agent**，基于这个 **model**，你的任务是 **coding**。但没有规则，所以我们开始更新这个系统。

解析：
* **baseline**：基线/起点
* **state-of-the-art**：最先进的
* **took a pass** 🔥：做了一次尝试/优化
* **语法点**：You can see...（情态动词 can 表示“能看到”）
