本文共 **29 个语义单元**，将全部翻译。

(1) [9:09-9:28] **The best way — it could be said this actually helps me stand out against AI. My writing isn't that polished yet. As I said before, millions of people have chosen to hit the subscribe button because they found some form of value in that writing. Now, throughout my journey as a writer, I've realized that writing is so much more than writing.**

最好的方式——可以说，这实际上帮助我在 AI 面前脱颖而出。我的写作还没那么精致，但正如我之前说的，数百万人选择点击了订阅按钮，因为他们从中找到了某种价值。在我的写作旅程中，我意识到写作远不止于写作本身。

解析：
* **stand out against**：从…中脱颖而出 🔥
* **polished** /ˈpɒlɪʃt/：精致的、打磨过的（adj.）
* **hit the subscribe button**：点击订阅按钮（口语化表达）
* **some form of value**：某种形式的价值
* **throughout my journey**：在我的整个旅程中

---

(2) [9:28-9:42] **It's not only just putting letters on a page. If you want to become articulate, you should probably start writing. That is, you should start writing intentionally because you already write. Every single day you text your family and friends, you email your prospects, clients, and coworkers.**

写作不仅仅是在纸上写字。如果你想变得善于表达，你大概应该开始写作——有意识地写，因为你其实已经在写了。每天你都在给家人朋友发消息，给潜在客户、现有客户和同事发邮件。

解析：
* **articulate** /ɑːrˈtɪkjələt/：善于表达的（adj.）🔥
* **intentionally** /ɪnˈtenʃənəli/：有意地、刻意地（adv.）
* **prospects**：潜在客户（n.）🔥

---

(3) [9:42-9:58] **And depending on your work, you may write project outlines, feedback, proposals, and more. If you really think about it, the foundation of media, which is how you or your employer gets your work in front of other people and persuades them to care about your work so you can survive and get paid, is writing.**

根据你的工作，你可能还要写项目大纲、反馈、提案等等。仔细想想，媒体的基础——也就是你或雇主把工作展示给别人、说服他们关注你从而让你能生存和赚钱的方式——就是写作。

解析：
* **project outlines**：项目大纲
* **proposals** /prəˈpoʊzəlz/：提案、方案（n.）
* **persuade** /pərˈsweɪd/：说服（v.）🔥
* **the foundation of**：…的基础

---

(4) [9:58-10:18] **Now media has evolved. If you want to succeed in any venture, you must go where the attention is. Right now, most of the attention is on social media, YouTube, podcasts, and advertisements like Facebook ads, all of which require you to articulate persuasively in the form of video scripts, sales copywriting, post captions, and anywhere else that someone is reading a written post or spoken script, which is nearly everything.**

如今媒体已经进化了。想在任何事业中成功，你必须去注意力聚集的地方。现在大部分注意力在社交媒体、YouTube、播客和 Facebook 广告上，都要求你能有说服力地表达——视频脚本、销售文案、帖子标题……几乎涵盖一切。

解析：
* **venture** /ˈventʃər/：事业、冒险项目（n.）🔥
* **articulate persuasively**：有说服力地表达 🔥
* **copywriting**：文案写作（n.）🔥
* **captions**：标题、字幕（n.）
* **go where the attention is**：去注意力聚集的地方

---

(5) [10:20-10:38] **That's personally why I write 1 to 2 hours every morning. It's because that's the foundation of literally my survival in everything I do. If I don't write on social media or my newsletter or YouTube script or emails to prospects, how am I going to ever get a customer for my own work? That's why I created my writing system.**

这就是我每天早上写 1 到 2 小时的原因——这真的是我所做一切的生存基础。如果我不在社交媒体上写、不写通讯、不写 YouTube 脚本、不给潜在客户发邮件——我怎么获取客户？所以我创建了自己的写作系统。

解析：
* **literally**：真正地（adv.），口语中用来强调
* **newsletter**：通讯、邮件订阅（n.）🔥
* **prospects**：潜在客户（n.）

---

(6) [10:38-10:56] **But by writing, that's how you practice articulating your ideas from the start. It's like a first draft, and then you refine it, and then you practice speaking it, and then you get really good at it. And as a bonus, by posting your ideas in public, you get direct feedback in the form of engagement so that you know which ideas are the most impactful.**

通过写作，你从一开始就在练习表达想法。就像先写初稿，然后打磨，再练习说出来，最终你就变得非常擅长。而且公开发布想法时，你会通过互动获得直接反馈，知道哪些想法最有影响力。

解析：
* **first draft**：初稿（n.）
* **refine** /rɪˈfaɪn/：打磨、精炼（v.）🔥
* **as a bonus**：作为额外收获
* **engagement** /ɪnˈɡeɪdʒmənt/：互动、参与度（n.）🔥
* **impactful**：有影响力的（adj.）

---

(7) [10:56-11:16] **And building an audience from that also doesn't hurt. So with that said, how do you actually start practicing articulation in the form of writing? That's what we're going to do — we're going to start with writing. So here are three frameworks. The first is beginner level and I'm calling it the micro story because the human mind is a story engine, humans can't help but pay attention to a story, especially if it's short and impactful.**

顺便建立受众群也不是坏事。那具体怎么用写作练习表达呢？我们就从写作开始，这里有三个框架。第一个是初级方法，我称之为「微故事」——因为人类大脑就是故事引擎，人们情不自禁地会关注故事，尤其是简短有力的。

解析：
* **doesn't hurt**：没什么坏处（口语表达）
* **framework** /ˈfreɪmwɜːrk/：框架、体系（n.）🔥
* **micro story**：微故事
* **can't help but**：情不自禁地… 🔥
* **story engine**：故事引擎（比喻大脑天然被故事吸引）

---

(8) [11:16-11:34] **Once you learn how to do it well, you can effectively short circuit someone's brain into being interested in the topic you were talking about. The foundation of a story is transformation. This does not have to be a transformation about a specific person. A transformation can be as simple as introducing a problem and giving a solution.**

一旦你学会了，就能有效地"短路"别人的大脑，让他们对你的话题产生兴趣。故事的基础是**转变**——不一定是某个人的转变，转变可以简单到只是提出问题并给出解决方案。

解析：
* **short circuit** /ʃɔːrt ˈsɜːrkɪt/：短路，比喻直接触发反应 🔥
* **transformation** /ˌtrænsfərˈmeɪʃən/：转变、蜕变（n.）🔥
* **as simple as**：简单到只是…

---

(9) [11:34-12:02] **And that's exactly what this is. So if you want to make that a bit more impactful — being able to just write a tiny, tiny story that isn't necessarily about a character, it's just a transformation — then you structure it like this. You start with a problem, so you state a relatable problem or pain point. Then you amplify the problem — you illustrate how that problem leads to a negative outcome if it is not solved. And then you give a solution.**

这就是微故事的本质。如果你想让它更有冲击力——写一个不需要人物的小故事，只是一个转变——就按这个结构来：**提出问题**，陈述一个有共鸣的痛点；**放大问题**，展示不解决会导致什么后果；最后**给出解决方案**。

解析：
* **relatable** /rɪˈleɪtəbl/：让人有共鸣的（adj.）🔥
* **pain point**：痛点（n.）🔥
* **amplify** /ˈæmplɪfaɪ/：放大、增强（v.）🔥
* **illustrate**：展示、说明（v.）
* **negative outcome**：负面后果

---

(10) [12:02-12:25] **And in something like a short social media post, this can be one sentence or a short bullet point list. In a long newsletter or script, this can be all of the key points with their explanations. The problem and amplification would account for the hook. So this section of the video would be the solution section of the Micro story framework — because I'm just going through the key points of how to actually solve the problem of not being able to articulate yourself.**

在短帖子里，解决方案可以是一句话或要点列表；在长通讯或脚本里可以展开所有关键点。「问题+放大」构成了**钩子**。这段视频当前部分就是微故事框架的「解决方案」环节——我在讲解如何解决不会表达的问题。

解析：
* **bullet point list**：要点列表
* **account for**：构成、占据（v.）
* **hook**：钩子，指开头吸引注意力的部分 🔥
* **amplification** /ˌæmplɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/：放大、强化（n.）

---

(11) [12:27-12:42] **Now, if you've studied copywriting at all, you've seen this framework before. It's called the PAS framework. And after six years of doing this, that's still my go-to when I'm just like, lost and don't know what to talk about, how to articulate it — I just go to this framework, start with the problem.**

学过文案写作的话，你肯定见过这个框架——叫 **PAS 框架**（Problem-Amplify-Solution）。做了六年了，当我迷茫不知道聊什么或怎么表达时，这仍然是我的首选——从问题开始。

解析：
* **PAS framework**：PAS 框架（Problem-Amplify-Solution）🔥
* **go-to** /ˈɡoʊtuː/：首选的、常用的（adj./n.）🔥
* **lost**：迷茫的、不知所措的（adj.）

---

(12) [12:42-12:57] **Okay, what's a problem? You don't know how to articulate yourself. Okay. How do you amplify that? What does that lead to down the road? You won't get the girl. You won't land the job. You won't be able to start your own business. You're going to live in your mom's basement for the rest of your life. Okay, what's the solution? Use the PAS framework.**

比如：问题？你不会表达。放大一下？长远看：追不到喜欢的人、拿不到工作、创不了业、余生住妈妈地下室。解决方案？用 **PAS** 框架。

解析：
* **down the road**：长远来看、将来 🔥
* **land the job**：拿到/搞定工作 🔥
* **basement** /ˈbeɪsmənt/：地下室（n.）

---

(13) [12:57-13:12] **That's a tweet you would actually probably do pretty good. You could expand that into a newsletter, turn that into a YouTube video, or you can say it on a podcast. When someone says, "what's the greatest skill to learn?" You say articulation. Why? Because most people don't know how to articulate themselves. Go into the amplify and solution. Do you see what I'm getting at now?**

这就能写成一条不错的推文，还能扩展成通讯、YouTube 视频或播客。有人问"最值得学的技能？"你说表达力。为什么？因为大多数人不知道怎么表达——然后展开放大和解决方案。你现在明白我意思了吧？

解析：
* **expand**：扩展（v.）
* **what I'm getting at**：我想说的是…、我的意思是… 🔥

---

(14) [13:12-13:33] **Of course, with all of this, this is assuming that you already have an idea to write about. If you have an idea, then just think of the problem. Amplify it. What's next? Give the solution. Boom. And if you don't have an idea, you need to hunt for them. You need to read old books. Go down rabbit holes on a topic, listen to a new podcast, or just sit with your thoughts and follow them until you reach a compelling insight.**

当然，以上都假设你已经有了想法。有想法就想想问题→放大→给方案，搞定！没想法的话就得去"猎取"——读老书、在某个话题上深挖、听新播客、或安静坐着跟着思绪走，直到找到有说服力的洞见。

解析：
* **assuming**：假设、前提是（v.）
* **hunt for**：搜寻、猎取（v.）🔥
* **go down rabbit holes**：深入钻研（来自"兔子洞"的比喻）🔥
* **compelling insight**：有说服力的洞见

---

(15) [13:33-13:49] **When you hunt for an idea, you aren't just letting the information go in one ear and out the other. You're listening intently for an idea that you wish you wrote. Then you jot it down so you don't lose it. Then you articulate it in your own words using these frameworks so it takes a new shape.**

"猎取"想法时，不是让信息左耳进右耳出。你要专注聆听，找一个你希望自己写过的想法。赶紧记下来别忘了，再用框架用自己的话表达出来，让它焕然一新。

解析：
* **go in one ear and out the other**：左耳进右耳出 🔥
* **intently** /ɪnˈtentli/：专注地（adv.）
* **jot it down**：快速记下来 🔥
* **take a new shape**：呈现新面貌

---

(16) [13:49-14:05] **Now the intermediate framework is called the pyramid principle. The pyramid principle is a communication framework that structures ideas in a hierarchical, logical way to make information more palatable and persuasive. And it's pretty simple. You start with the main idea, the key conclusion or recommendation. You support it with key arguments, usually 3 to 5 key points. You provide detailed evidence — data, examples, or analysis.**

中级框架叫**金字塔原理**——用层级化、逻辑化的方式组织想法，让信息更易接受、更有说服力。方法很简单：先给核心观点（结论或建议），再用 3 到 5 个关键论据支撑，最后提供详细证据——数据、案例或分析。

解析：
* **pyramid principle**：金字塔原理 🔥
* **hierarchical** /ˌhaɪəˈrɑːrkɪkəl/：层级化的（adj.）
* **palatable** /ˈpælətəbl/：容易接受的、合口味的（adj.）🔥
* **evidence**：证据（n.）

---

(17) [14:05-14:22] **And unlike most content today that waits to give you the answer until the end of the video or newsletter, this takes an answer-first approach. Now this works perfectly with the example from before with Hormozi, where if his answer to "what is the greatest skill you can learn" is "the ability to stay in a great mood in the absence of things" — that can serve as the top of the pyramid.**

不像如今大多数内容要等到最后才给答案，这个框架是「答案优先」。拿之前 **Hormozi** 的例子——"最值得学的技能"的回答是"在缺少东西时仍能保持好心情"，这就是金字塔的顶端。

解析：
* **answer-first approach**：答案优先的方式 🔥
* **in the absence of**：在缺少…的情况下
* **serve as**：作为、充当（v.）
* **the top of the pyramid**：金字塔的顶端

---

(18) [14:22-14:46] **You're not starting with the problem, you're not starting with anything else. You're starting with the idea, the conclusion, the answer. Then he could support that argument or that idea with key arguments as to why he thinks that's the best skill to learn. All you have to do is ask "why" 3 to 5 times and come up with a compelling answer.**

你不从问题开始，不从别的开始——直接从想法、结论、答案开始。然后他可以用关键论据来支撑为什么他认为这是最值得学的技能。你要做的就是问 3 到 5 次"为什么"，并想出有说服力的回答。

解析：
* **support that argument**：支撑那个论点
* **as to why**：关于为什么
* **come up with**：想出、提出 🔥
* **compelling**：有说服力的、引人注目的（adj.）🔥

---

(19) [14:46-15:06] **And then after that, he can give examples from his own life, data about being in a great mood — if he has the data or statistics on hand — or just anecdotes from people in his life or clients or customers. I've also seen this framework be used in YouTube videos as well. If you are scrolling the YouTube timeline, try to pay attention to this. Try to notice these frameworks.**

之后他可以举自己生活中的例子、关于好心情的数据（如果手头有的话），或者来自身边人、客户的小故事。我在 YouTube 视频里也见过这个框架。刷 YouTube 时间线时，试着留意一下这些框架。

解析：
* **on hand**：手头上、在手边
* **anecdotes** /ˈænɪkdoʊts/：轶事、小故事（n.）🔥
* **scrolling**：滚动浏览（v.）
* **pay attention to**：注意、留意

---

(20) [15:06-15:22] **You'll see some titles that just state the problem. You'll notice some titles that just state a really big idea. And once you understand these frameworks, you can just see them everywhere. So for the pyramid principle, you start with a great idea, you make an argument about it, and then you support it with data.**

你会发现有些标题直接陈述问题，有些直接抛出一个大想法。一旦你理解了这些框架，就会到处看到它们。所以金字塔原理就是：先抛出好想法，提出论点，然后用数据支撑。

解析：
* **state**：陈述（v.）
* **make an argument**：提出论点

---

(21) [15:22-15:46] **Now, if you struggle to continue writing or speaking, or you just get stuck or feel like you have writer's block or speaker's block, this next framework is really going to help. This is the advanced framework — cross-domain synthesis. And this one is my favorite because I have multiple interests. It's hard for me to stick to one topic or niche.**

如果你在持续写作或演讲时遇到困难，陷入写作瓶颈或表达瓶颈，接下来这个框架会很有帮助。这是高级框架——**跨领域综合**。这是我最爱的，因为我兴趣广泛，很难只专注一个话题或细分领域。

解析：
* **writer's block**：写作瓶颈（n.）🔥
* **cross-domain synthesis**：跨领域综合 🔥
* **niche** /niːʃ/：细分领域、利基（n.）🔥
* **stick to**：坚持、专注于

---

(22) [15:46-16:08] **I want to weave things in. I'm reading things throughout the week and watching videos, studying new things. I want to incorporate those in my life somehow beyond just consuming information. I love studying psychology, philosophy, health, business, design, tech, and really anything that gives me the tools to live a better life. So this framework is how I tend to structure most of my newsletters — not all of them, but most — outside of the ones where I'm just focused on a singular tactical topic like this one.**

我想把各种东西融合进去——整周都在读书看视频学新东西，想让它们超越单纯消费。我爱研究心理学、哲学、健康、商业、设计、科技——任何能帮我活得更好的东西。这个框架是我大多数通讯的结构（除了像这期只讲实操的）。

解析：
* **weave in** /wiːv/：融入、编织进去（v.）🔥
* **incorporate** /ɪnˈkɔːrpəreɪt/：融合、纳入（v.）🔥
* **consuming information**：消费信息
* **tactical**：实操的、战术性的（adj.）

---

(23) [16:09-16:35] **So here's the framework. First is problem and amplify — your introduction should state a relatable problem and illustrate what happens if that problem is not solved. Second is cross-domain synthesis — patterns or concepts from your other interests that help support your argument. If I'm talking about deep work, I can use the concept of entropy from physics to illustrate how distractions work. This teaches my audience something new, and I can sleep well knowing that all other deep work content out there does not do this.**

框架如下：①**问题+放大**——开头陈述有共鸣的问题和不解决的后果。②**跨领域综合**——从其他兴趣中找支撑论点的概念。比如讲**深度工作**时用物理学的「熵」来说明干扰如何运作，教给受众新东西——别的同类内容做不到这点。

解析：
* **entropy** /ˈentrəpi/：熵（物理学概念）
* **deep work**：深度工作 🔥
* **distractions**：干扰、分心（n.）
* **sleep well knowing**：安心地知道…

---

(24) [16:35-17:02] **And third, you have a unique process or solution — a list of ideas or steps that best solve the problem you introduced at the beginning, solidifying the transformation. These should come from your own contemplation rather than someone else's prescription. You should actually think through "what is the best way to solve the problem" rather than "I watched this YouTube video, he had a good solution, I'm going to take that and put it in mine."**

③**独特的流程或方案**——列出最能解决问题的步骤，巩固转变。要来自你自己的深思，不是照搬别人的处方。真正想一想最佳方式是什么，而不是看了个 YouTube 视频觉得不错就直接搬来用。

解析：
* **solidifying** /səˈlɪdɪfaɪɪŋ/：巩固（v.）
* **contemplation** /ˌkɒntəmˈpleɪʃən/：深思、沉思（n.）🔥
* **prescription** /prɪˈskrɪpʃən/：处方（n.），比喻别人开的方子
* **think through**：想透、彻底思考 🔥

---

(25) [17:02-17:27] **So in practice, let's say you're writing a newsletter, or an article, or a Twitter thread, or an Instagram carousel, or a YouTube video script — something longer form so that you can articulate for 10 to 20 minutes. You'd have the title of your piece, the introduction with the problem, a section that teaches a concept from another interest or discipline, then a unique way to solve the problem in the form of multiple sections describing each key point.**

实操中，假设你在写通讯、文章、推文串、轮播或视频脚本等长内容。结构就是：标题、带问题的引言、来自其他学科的概念讲解、然后多个段落分别描述关键点的独特解决方案。

解析：
* **in practice**：在实际操作中
* **Twitter thread**：推文串（连续多条相关推文）
* **Instagram carousel**：Instagram 轮播帖
* **discipline** /ˈdɪsəplɪn/：学科、领域（n.）

---

(26) [17:27-17:48] **Now the problem here is that this leads to something very long — like a newsletter book, or a YouTube video, or even a solo podcast. And if you're just starting out, you'll be staring at a blank screen because you don't know how to fill in each section. Now, luckily, writing is like Legos with ideas, and ideas come in predictable forms. If you understand those forms, you can guide your mind to brainstorming what to write next.**

问题是这会导致内容很长——长文、视频甚至播客。刚起步的话，你会盯着空白屏幕发呆。但好消息是，**写作就像搭乐高**——想法有可预测的形式，理解这些形式就能引导大脑构思下一步写什么。

解析：
* **staring at a blank screen**：盯着空白屏幕（形容写作瓶颈）
* **Legos with ideas**：用想法搭乐高（比喻）🔥
* **predictable forms**：可预测的形式
* **brainstorming**：头脑风暴、构思（v.）

---

(27) [17:48-18:13] **Here are a few easy ones. You can use a pain point — if I don't know how to start a section, I start with the relevant pain point and ideas start to flow. An example — once I've started a section you can throw an example in anywhere, this grounds what you're saying. A personal story — think to a time in your life that relates to what you're writing about. A statistic — research a truthful statistic that adds more authority to your point.**

几个好用的"积木"：**痛点**——不知道怎么开头就从痛点入手，灵感就涌出来了。**举例**——随时插入例子让观点落地。**个人故事**——回想与写作内容相关的经历。**统计数据**——找真实数据增加权威性。

解析：
* **pain point**：痛点 🔥
* **flow**：涌出、流动（v.）
* **grounds what you're saying**：让你说的话更实在 🔥
* **authority** /əˈθɔːrəti/：权威性（n.）

---

(28) [18:13-18:38] **You can use a metaphor — explain a complex idea as if you're talking to a child. Alan Watts is incredible at this. You can use a quote that justifies what you're saying — quotes are easy because they're almost always great ideas. You can use a reframe — give people a different perspective. Or you can just ask what, how, or why — because when all else fails, writing and speaking, or just thinking, is questioning.**

**比喻**——把复杂概念讲得像跟小孩说话，**Alan Watts** 就是大师。**引用**——加入证实观点的名言，引用好用因为几乎都是好想法。**重新框定**——给人不同视角。或直接**问什么、怎么、为什么**——因为一切行不通时，表达的本质就是提问。

解析：
* **metaphor** /ˈmetəfɔːr/：比喻、隐喻（n.）🔥
* **reframe** /riːˈfreɪm/：重新框定、换角度看 🔥
* **justify**：证实、证明合理（v.）
* **when all else fails**：当一切都行不通时 🔥

---

(29) [18:38-19:21] **So if you didn't screenshot those, you probably should — because those are the Legos. Writing is Legos with ideas and those are the Legos that you piece together to articulate sentence after sentence or paragraph after paragraph. If I don't know what to write or say next, I tend to cycle through those in my head or latch on to the closest one. And once you get the hang of this, as with any skill, it becomes second nature and your thinking process starts to evolve. I hope that was helpful enough to get you started. I would highly recommend joining the paid tier of my Substack — there are many drills and techniques and courses on writing, marketing, and business. Like and subscribe before you leave, and I'll see you in the next video. Bye.**

没截图的话赶紧截——那些就是"乐高积木"。写作就是用想法搭乐高，一句接一句、一段接一段地拼。不知道下一步写什么时，我会在脑子里过一遍，抓住最合适的。一旦掌握了这个技巧，它会变成第二天性，思维会不断进化。希望这些能帮你起步，推荐加入我 **Substack** 的付费层级，有很多写作、营销和商业的练习和课程。记得点赞订阅，下期见！

解析：
* **piece together**：拼装、组合（v.）🔥
* **cycle through**：逐一过一遍 🔥
* **latch on to**：抓住、紧紧依附 🔥
* **get the hang of**：掌握诀窍 🔥
* **second nature**：第二天性、本能反应 🔥
* **paid tier**：付费层级
* **drills**：练习、训练（n.）
