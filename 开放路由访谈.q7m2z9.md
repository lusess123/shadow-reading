(1) [0:00-0:12] **you might think is just internal tooling, but we have a lot of internal tooling, just so you know. which is why Effect is actually being used a lot. So, instead of running a Python eval suite on the market, there's a bunch, we write our own, but it's using Effect.**

你可能觉得这只是内部工具，但我们内部工具很多，所以 **Effect** 实际被用得很频繁，在内部非常常见。与其用市面上的 **Python** 评测套件，我们自己写了一套，而且是基于 **Effect** 的。

解析：
* **internal tooling**：内部工具（名词）
* **eval suite**：评测套件（名词）
* **instead of** 🔥：而不是、与其（介词短语）
* **which is why**：原因/结果从句，说明“因此...”

---

(2) [0:19-0:40] **and so on and so forth. it's a very sophisticated system. I'm just saying is that if we use, you might think internal tooling is like some toy, but no, we're actually using it almost on a daily basis, it's actually production load. testing out all the endpoint, right? Which is a crucial part of our operation. well, I mean, almost every respond transformation is using the pipe now. And then also I'm introducing more and more generator. So, down the line, we finally will, it will be making it easier for us to transitioning over to Effect as needed.**

这些都在用 **Effect** 跑，是个很复杂的系统。我只是想说，内部工具不是玩具，我们几乎每天用它跑生产负载，测试所有 **endpoint**，这是运营的关键部分。现在几乎每个响应转换都在用 **pipe**，我也在加更多 **generator**，以后需要迁到 **Effect** 会更顺。

解析：
* **sophisticated**：精密复杂的（形容词）
* **production load**：生产负载（名词）
* **endpoint**：接口端点（名词）
* **down the line** 🔥：将来、以后（副词短语）

---

(3) [0:49-1:09] **Welcome to Cause & Effect a podcast about the TypeScript library and ecosystem called Effect, helping engineers to build production-ready software. I'm your host, Johannes Schickling, and I've been building with Effect for over four years. With this podcast, I want to help others understand the powers and benefits of using Effect.**

欢迎来到 **Cause & Effect** 播客，讨论名为 **Effect** 的 **TypeScript** 库及其生态，帮助工程师构建可上生产的软件。我是主持人 **Johannes Schickling**，我使用 **Effect** 已经四年多。希望通过这个节目帮助更多人理解使用 **Effect** 的力量与收益。

解析：
* **ecosystem**：生态系统（名词）
* **production-ready**：可上生产的（形容词）
* **host**：主持人（名词）
* **have been doing... for**：现在完成进行时，表示从过去持续到现在

(4) [1:09-1:30] **In this episode, I'm talking to Louis Vichy, co-founder of OpenRouter, the unified interface for LLMs. In this conversation, we dive deep into the Cloudflare workers architecture, their routing layers, and how they're replacing their own result type implementation with Effect for better retries, observability, and long-running agentic workflows. Let's get into it.**

这一集我和 **Louis Vichy** 聊，他是 **OpenRouter** 的联合创始人，**OpenRouter** 是面向 **LLMs** 的统一接口。我们会深入聊 **Cloudflare** workers 的架构、路由层，以及他们如何用 **Effect** 替换自家的结果类型实现，以获得更好的重试、可观测性和长时间运行的 **agentic** 工作流。开始吧。

解析：
* **co-founder**：联合创始人（名词）
* **unified interface**：统一接口（名词）
* **observability**：可观测性（名词）
* **how + 从句**：宾语从句结构，说明“如何...”

---

(5) [1:30-2:00] **Hey, welcome everyone. It's so nice to have you here. Louis, you're from OpenRouter. Would you mind introducing yourself? We also have the Effect co-creator Michael here. Awesome. How are you all? I'm Luis. I'm a co-founder of OpenRouter. Me and my co-founder, we met through GitHub essentially. He was building out a V0 of OpenRouter using a framework I was building for my previous startup and that's how we met. Then we just love collaborating with each other and then around May is when OpenRouter first launched May 2023. So early 2023.**

欢迎大家，见到你们很开心。**Louis**，你来自 **OpenRouter**，能自我介绍吗？这里还有 **Effect** 的共同创造者 **Michael**。我是 **Luis**，**OpenRouter** 联合创始人。我和合伙人在 **GitHub** 认识，他用我之前创业的框架搭了 **OpenRouter** 的 **V0**，于是合作，约在 2023 年 5 月上线。

解析：
* **Would you mind...** 🔥：礼貌请求
* **co-creator**：共同创造者（名词）
* **build out**：搭建、完善（动词短语）
* **around May**：大约在五月（时间表达）

---

(6) [2:00-2:20] **Essentially, the idea of OpenRouter is at the bare bone, it is actually a switchboard for AI models. That's it. We reduce the switching cost between like Anthropic and OpenAI and Gemini, and Moonshot, Cohere, and Meta to essentially zero.**

**OpenRouter** 的核心想法很简单，本质上就是 **AI** 模型的“交换机/切换台”，说白了就是帮你在模型之间做调度，也就是一个统一入口。我们把 **Anthropic**、**OpenAI**、**Gemini**、**Moonshot**、**Cohere**、**Meta** 之间的切换成本几乎降到零。

解析：
* **switchboard**：交换机/切换台（名词）
* **switching cost**：切换成本（名词）
* **reduce ... to zero**：把...降到零
* **bare bone(s)**：最基本部分（名词短语）

---

(7) [2:20-2:45] **We're also centralizing all the payment for you. Instead of like 60 different providers, you pay just us and then you get some credit, and then you can call any AI model you want. Essentially, that is the basic part of OpenRouter, but OpenRouter is actually much more than that. You have seen Elon tweet about us on X. The secondary product of OpenRouter is the data that we are allowing everyone else to access.**

我们还把支付集中起来：不必对接 60 个供应商，只需付给我们拿到额度，就能调用任意 **AI** 模型。这只是 **OpenRouter** 的基础功能，实际远不止这些。你可能在 **X** 上看过 **Elon** 提到我们，**OpenRouter** 的第二个产品是向外部开放的数据。

解析：
* **centralizing payments**：集中支付（动词短语）
* **credit**：额度/余额（名词）
* **secondary product**：第二产品线（名词）
* **not just... but...**：强调“远不止...”

---

(8) [2:45-3:09] **The data about which model is being spent on the most, or which model is getting the most utility. We measure them based on tokens. A token is about roughly full characters. Last week, we did about five trillion tokens a week. Exactly a year ago though, we were doing about 150 billion tokens a week. That's roughly about more than 20x growth.**

这些数据告诉你哪种模型花费最多、效用最高，也就是最常被用。我们按 **token** 计量，**token** 大致相当于字符。上周我们每周约 5 万亿 **token**，而一年前只有约 1500 亿，增长超过 20 倍。

解析：
* **utility**：效用/使用价值（名词）
* **token**：标记/令牌（名词，NLP 单位）
* **roughly**：大约（副词）
* **more than 20x**：超过 20 倍（倍数表达）

---

(9) [3:09-3:35] **By the way, this feature was released literally the first month of the product, I think. Basically, my co-founder and I were thinking about, "Okay, we have this data. Should we just let everyone see it?" Because at the time, there were so many benchmarks. There were so many Llama or Meta Llama benchmark, Llama one, right? They're claiming some of these Llama fighting will be better than GPT 3.5. And we were like, "Is that actually the case?"**

顺便说，这个功能在产品第一个月就上线了。我们当时在想：“既然有数据，要不要让所有人都看到？”因为那时基准评测太多了，**Llama** 或 **Meta Llama** 的基准一堆，甚至宣称某些 **Llama** 会比 **GPT 3.5** 更强，我们就怀疑这是否属实。

解析：
* **feature**：功能（名词）
* **benchmark**：基准评测（名词）
* **claim** 🔥：声称（动词）
* **were thinking about...**：过去进行时，表示正在考虑

---

(10) [3:35-4:04] **Because when we were trying them locally, they're dumb as hell. So we were like, "Okay, let's make a benchmark that's based on real utilization, real usage, real money, being bet on the model, like a horse race. And see which one get the most of this money." And that's essentially is the secondary product, which is the ranking page where everyone can see which model is being spent the most on. And we do cap the amount of free usage on a provider. So all of that is actual usage. Like people spending money.**

我们本地试过后觉得并不靠谱，于是想做一个基于真实使用、真实花费的榜单，像赛马一样看哪匹“花费最多”。这就成了第二个产品：排行榜页面，大家能看到哪款模型被花得最多。我们还会限制供应商的免费用量，所以数据反映的都是实际付费。

解析：
* **utilization**：使用量/利用率（名词）
* **horse race**：赛马式竞争（比喻）
* **ranking page**：排行榜页面（名词）
* **cap** 🔥：限制、封顶（动词）

---

(11) [4:04-4:47] **That is awesome. So you mentioned you met your co-founder in 2023, May 2023. Now more than two years later, where are you at in terms of a company? Is it just the two of you? Probably not. So maybe you can shed some light on like OpenRouter as a company. So we were two people writing on the thing. He was checking Datadog. I was just writing code for up until January. And then we have our first engineering hire who also joined us through an open source project. We released a couple of open source project at the time, early 2024. And then Sam joined us through he sent us a PR on another project. and then we still have him to this day.**

太棒了。你提到在 2023 年 5 月认识合伙人，两年多后公司规模如何？还是两个人吗？能否介绍一下 **OpenRouter**。我们最初只有两个人在写代码，他看 **Datadog**，我一直写到一月。随后第一位工程师通过开源项目加入；2024 年初我们发了几个开源项目，**Sam** 因另一个项目的 **PR** 加入，至今仍在。

解析：
* **shed some light on** 🔥：解释/说明
* **in terms of**：就...而言
* **open source**：开源（形容词/名词）
* **PR**：拉取请求（名词）

---

(12) [4:47-5:04] **last year we have four people. Now we have about 22. So team grow about 5x, but the utilization has grew more than 20x. So I think we have a decent wiggle room. We make enough of coffee, right? So got to buy more coffee. essentially the growth curve is exactly the same. The first year we went from zero to 7 billion.**

去年我们只有 4 个人，现在约 22 人，团队增长约 5 倍，但使用量增长超过 20 倍，所以还有不小余地。我们赚够咖啡钱，还得买更多咖啡。增长曲线几乎一样，第一年我们从 0 做到每周 70 亿 **token**。

解析：
* **wiggle room** 🔥：回旋余地（名词）
* **grow 5x**：增长 5 倍（表达）
* **growth curve**：增长曲线（名词）
* **utilization**：使用量/利用率（名词）

---

(13) [5:04-5:29] **7 billion token, you know, in a week. And that's when I showed my dad. And then a year later, September 2024, we went to about 150 billion. And that's when I show, you know, my friend is my south friend. And now, right, I'm showing you guys and a lot of people we're interviewing, we have five trillion. So it's been 20x and then more than 20x. Hopefully the next year we'll be higher, but we'll see, right?**

这 70 亿 **token/周** 时我给我爸看。再过一年到 2024 年 9 月，我们到约 1500 亿，我给朋友看。现在我给你们和面试的人看，我们已到每周 5 万亿，增长 20 倍以上，希望明年更高，但还得看。

解析：
* **a year later**：一年后
* **trillion**：万亿（名词/数词）
* **that's when...**：强调时间点“那时...”
* **hopefully**：希望，但带不确定性

---

(14) [5:29-5:59] **Well, AI usage is only gonna increase. And as far as I know, from friends and so on and so forth, OpenRouter is probably the best way to access those different models. We had internal conversations and one key aspect that I truly like about what you do is that you're not just a proxy to models. You actually consolidate the model responses, which is key here.**

**AI** 使用量只会继续增长，按我从朋友那里的了解，**OpenRouter** 可能是访问这些模型的最佳方式。我们内部也讨论过，我很喜欢的一点是你们不只是模型 **proxy**，而是把不同模型的响应做了统一整合，这一点非常关键。

解析：
* **as far as I know** 🔥：据我所知（插入语）
* **proxy**：代理（名词）
* **consolidate** 🔥：整合、汇总（动词）
* **key aspect**：关键点（名词）

---

(15) [5:59-6:47] **So a lot of people actually mistake us as a wrapper, right? Building a wrapper is very easy, but building a dev tool is hard. Building a dev tool on top of the API is extremely hard, right, because you have to ensure that the Dev X, the user experience of the developer is actually good so that they can stick to us. And this is the key kind of mistake that people didn't think about until they need us, right? We have seen this a lot, by the way, is that user essentially didn't think too much of OpenRouter, they try it once, they're like, "Okay, I'm gonna use two or three model, it doesn't matter, so I'm gonna do my own." A lot of people have built their own OpenRouters. And then the moment they have to say, "Okay, now I have to add Anthropic, you know, Claude 4.5 came out, they have to scramble their entire weekends, right? Either weekends or they're Tuesday and Wednesday to add a model."**

很多人把我们当成 **wrapper**，但做 **wrapper** 容易，做开发者工具难，尤其是建在 **API** 之上的工具。你必须保证 **DevX** 好，用户才会留下；很多人直到需要我们时才意识到这一点。我们经常看到有人只想用两三个模型就自己搭一个 **OpenRouter**，可一旦要加 **Anthropic**、**Claude 4.5**，就得把周末甚至周二周三全搭进去。

解析：
* **wrapper**：封装层（名词）
* **DevX**：开发者体验（名词）
* **stick to** 🔥：继续使用、坚持用（动词短语）
* **scramble**：手忙脚乱（动词）

---

(16) [6:47-7:18] **With OpenRouter, it's right there, right? You add the same code, you allow your user to switch up model name, you're done. And that essentially has been a case of how OpenRouter has been growing, is that every time there's a new model, we do partner with this model to launch them early, and then the moment the model is launched is outright on OpenRouter and people who miss the train, right, come back to us, and need people coming in because they also want to try the model. That's kind of essentially the growth engine we have had thus far, which is leveraging our partnership with all this new model coming in.**

用 **OpenRouter** 就很简单：代码不变，只让用户切换模型名就行。我们的增长也来自这里：每有新模型，我们会合作提前上线，一发布就能在 **OpenRouter** 用，错过首发的人会回流，想试新模型的也会进来。这就是目前的增长引擎。

解析：
* **switch up** 🔥：切换、改动（动词短语）
* **partner with**：与...合作（动词短语）
* **miss the train** 🔥：错过首发/错过机会（口语）
* **growth engine**：增长引擎（名词）

---

(17) [7:18-7:43] **Can you maybe categorize sort of like the products you had to build out over the years, and also maybe orthogonally the challenges that maybe you hit right away or that just appeared over time, I suppose, like working at that scale, just like pulling on that scale thread, there's probably like so many interesting challenges that are coming towards us. So the one thing that me and my co-founder really like is to have type safety, to be honest.**

你能否概括这些年你们构建的产品，也谈谈在规模化过程中，起初就遇到或后来出现的挑战？在这种规模下会冒出很多有意思的问题。我和合伙人最看重的一点就是类型安全。

解析：
* **orthogonally**：从另一个维度（副词）
* **at that scale**：在这种规模下（短语）
* **type safety**：类型安全（名词）
* **build out**：逐步建设、完善（动词短语）

---

(18) [7:43-8:19] **Why Everything Runs in TypeScript. So, I kid you not, like the initial version of OpenRouter all the models, all the endpoints, were TypeScript object, TypeScript literal type object in the code. And then the way that we do reference, we would do strict type satisfy. As a way to do literally like foreign key reference in the code. So our code were a huge database of these endpoints it's not crazy. The moment we add a new field, right, an alert, right, because of TypeScript and satisfy, an alert across all our code base saying, hey, you have to add this field in every, you know, this place.**

“为什么一切都用 **TypeScript**”。真的不夸张，**OpenRouter** 最初版本里，所有模型和端点都是代码里的 **TypeScript** 对象和字面量类型。我们用严格的 `satisfy` 来做引用，相当于代码里的 **foreign key**。整个代码库就像一个端点数据库，新增字段时会因 **TypeScript** 的检查在全库报警，提示你要在每个位置补上。

解析：
* **literal type**：字面量类型（名词）
* **satisfy**：满足类型约束（关键字）
* **foreign key**：外键（名词）
* **the moment** 🔥：一...就...（连词）

---

(19) [8:19-8:47] **And then at the time, right, when we add new model, we add new endpoint, we just tell Devin to do it. It's automated because of type, because of type safety, right? The moment we just want to add something, we tell the model, it changed something, and then the rest is just TypeScript, you know, at type error. So it was not that crazy. It was actually usable. even satisfying a bunch of, you know, like literal number constraint as well, which is very fun.**

当时新增模型和端点时，我们直接让 **Devin** 去做，这能自动化是因为类型安全。只要想加东西，就让模型改代码，其余就是 **TypeScript** 的类型报错来指引。其实完全可用，连一些字面量数字约束也能满足，挺好玩。

解析：
* **automated**：自动化的（形容词）
* **type error**：类型错误（名词）
* **constraint**：约束（名词）
* **the moment** 🔥：一...就...（连词）

---

(20) [8:54-9:32] **I mean, you know, fun doesn't scale, right? So we'll talk a lot more about the data in a moment, but is this entire system still written all in TypeScript or have you moved some parts that are maybe like critical to be more efficient? Are those written in Go and Rust or is everything still in TypeScript? Nope, everything. Everything's still in TypeScript. We very much just TypeScript all in. I mean, the main reason why I think is fine for OpenRouter to be strictly TypeScript is because, I mean, that won't lie, right? When we actually hit the bottleneck, we sure will switch to Go and so on, but right now we're running on top of, you know, Cloudflare. And essentially, the Cloudflare worker is much, you know, better to use TypeScript with. The tight strictness of TypeScript and also the flexible, the dynamic nature of it, right? Allow us to move much faster. The velocity of the engineers is much faster, I would argue.**

好玩不代表能扩展，所以我稍后再聊数据，不过我想问：整个系统还是全 **TypeScript** 吗？有没有为了效率把部分改成 **Go** 或 **Rust**？没有，全部仍是 **TypeScript**。**OpenRouter** 现在跑在 **Cloudflare** 上，**Cloudflare** worker 更适合 **TypeScript**；它既严格又灵活，让工程师速度更快。

解析：
* **bottleneck**：瓶颈（名词）
* **strictness**：严格性（名词）
* **velocity**：速度/研发效率（名词）
* **is fine for**：对...可行

---

(21) [9:32-10:28] **Technically Go can do the same. It's just that we start with TypeScript and we use TypeScript almost everywhere on both front end and back end, right? So I think it's best for a team to have the same language. I mean, time and time again, I mean, time and time again, the same story sort of like repeats, right? Yep. Like if you're looking at Facebook and Mark having written the first Facebook prototype in PHP, guess what? Still mostly in PHP. Yeah. The same for like-- Instead of switching from PHP, they ended up making a new kind of Built the hack. Yeah, exactly. Or it's like, I mean, that's how TypeScript came to be. It's like, I would say the rationale of just, the whole idea, right, is that let's make sure we just speak the same language. So, in our code base, everything is TypeScript.**

理论上 **Go** 也能做到，但我们一开始就选 **TypeScript**，前后端几乎都用它，所以团队统一语言最合适。这样的故事一次又一次发生：比如 **Facebook** 首个原型是 **PHP**，现在仍主要是 **PHP**，他们没换语言，而是做了 **Hack**。这也是 **TypeScript** 的思路：让大家说同一种语言，所以我们代码里一切都是 **TypeScript**。

解析：
* **prototype**：原型（名词）
* **rationale**：理由/根本依据（名词）
* **time and time again** 🔥：一次又一次（短语）
* **same language**：统一语言（概念）

---

(22) [10:28-11:17] **Even the scripting is TypeScript. No bash. We don't use bash. We use ZX and TS up to write script to run like database migration or something like that. Or like even instant response scripts or something like that. So that every time that we communicate is in the same language. And so that someone else can pick it up, right? And we never really have dead code because TypeScript is very easy to kind of pull into a shared package and then you can reuse it. Honestly, I'm kind of surprised that this is not more common. In the Ruby on Rails world, for example, it's like so normal. Like obviously you build all of your scripts as Ruby scripts and then you run them. it's so surprising to me that in a JavaScript repo where like arguably it's as nice, if not nicer, to write scripts in JavaScript. This is like in the name. Like there's still often like more bash script than like custom JavaScript files.**

脚本也用 **TypeScript**，不写 **bash**。我们用 **ZX** 和 **TS** 写脚本跑数据库迁移或即时响应脚本，这样沟通同一种语言，别人也容易接手；而且代码易抽成共享包复用，基本不会有死代码。我挺惊讶这不常见：在 **Ruby on Rails** 里大家都用 **Ruby** 写脚本；但在 **JavaScript** 仓库里，写 **JavaScript** 脚本一样方便，却常常 **bash** 比自定义 **JavaScript** 还多。

解析：
* **scripting**：写脚本（名词/动名词）
* **migration**：迁移（名词）
* **dead code**：死代码（名词）
* **arguably**：可以说（副词）
